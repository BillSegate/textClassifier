Medical symptoms refer to the manifestations or indications of a disease or condition, perceived and complained about by the patient. Patients observe these symptoms and seek medical advice from healthcare professionals. 
Because most people are not diagnostically trained or knowledgeable, they typically describe their symptoms in layman's terms, rather than using specific medical terminology. This list is not exhaustive.

Symptoms by presentation
Medical signs and symptoms
Where available, ICD-10 codes are listed. When codes are available both as a sign/symptom (R code) and as an underlying condition, the code for the sign is used.
When there is no symptoms for a disease that a patient has, the patient is said to be asymptomatic.
