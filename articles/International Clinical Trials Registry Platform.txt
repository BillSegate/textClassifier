The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is a platform for the registration of clinical trials operated by the World Health Organization.The ICTRP combines data from multiple cooperating clinical trials registries to generate a global view of clinical trials worldwide, with a search portal that allows access to the entire dataset. It requires a minimum standard set of database fields, the   WHO Trial Registration Data Set, to be present for a trial to be registered. All entries are given a Universal Trial Number (UTN) that identifies them uniquely.The organization has sought to assist various national governments in establishing their own clinical trials databases.
As of October 2020, it combines data from the following primary source registries:
Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR)
Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (ReBec)
