The Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ or SAD-Q) is a 20 item clinical screening tool designed to measure the presence and level of alcohol dependence.It is divided into five sections:

Physical withdrawal symptoms
Affective withdrawal symptoms
Craving and relief drinking
Typical daily consumption
Reinstatement of dependence after a period of abstinence.Each item is scored on a 4-point scale, giving a possible range of 0 to 60. A score of over 30 indicates severe alcohol dependence.Some local clinical guidelines use the SADQ to predict the levels of medication needed during alcohol detoxification.
