The Easmon family or the Easmon Medical Dynasty is a Sierra Leone Creole medical dynasty of African-American descent originally based in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The Easmon family has ancestral roots in the United States, and in particular Savannah, Georgia and other states in the American South. There are several descendants of the Sierra Leonean family in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as in the Ghanaian cities of Accra and Kumasi. The family produced several medical doctors beginning with John Farrell Easmon, the medical doctor who coined the term Blackwater fever and wrote the first clinical diagnosis of the disease linking it to malaria and Albert Whiggs Easmon, who was a leading gynaecologist in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Several members of the family were active in business, academia, politics, the arts including music, cultural dance, playwriting and literature, history, anthropology, cultural studies, and anti-colonial activism against racism. 
The Easmon family was among the wealthy, upper-class and aristocratic Creole families, known locally as the Aristos and descended from one of the original black American founding families which established the Colony of Sierra Leone in 1792.

History
The surname Easmon is a variation of the English surname "Eastman" derived from "Eastmond". The Easmon family descends from the 1,192 African Americans known in Sierra Leone as the Nova Scotian Settlers who established the Colony of Sierra Leone and the city of Freetown. The earliest known progenitor of the Easmon family was William Easmon, (d. 1831), an African American trader possibly from North Carolina, who was one of the original Nova Scotian Settler emigrés from Nova Scotia, Canada, who established Freetown, Sierra Leone on 11 March 1792. William Easmon had at least one son with his first wife, Mary Easmon and had several children, including Walter Richard Easmon (1824–1883), with his second wife, Jane Easmon. Walter Richard Easmon was a merchant based in the Republic of Guinea who was married three times. Walter Richard Easmon was the father of three children with his second wife, Mary Ann MacCormac, including John Farrell Easmon. Walter Easmon was also the father of Albert Whiggs Easmon with Mah Serah, a Susu woman from the Republic of Guinea.
Several branches of the Easmon family intermarried with Creole families of African American, Jamaican Maroon,
Northern Irish, French, and English descent including the Boyle, Cuthbert, Elliott, George, MacCormac, Maillat, and Smith, and Spilsbury families. The Easmon family also extends to Ghana and branches of the family in Ghana intermarried mainly with Ga-Dangme families of Sierra Leone Creole, Danish, Scottish, and Welsh descent including the Dove, Augustt, and Evans families.
Members of the Easmon family were prominent in the medical field in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Foremost among the nineteenth century doctors of the family were John Farrell Easmon and Albert Whiggs Easmon. The twentieth century was largely dominated by the careers of Macormack Charles Farrell Easmon, who served in the colonial medical service and Raymond Sarif Easmon who established himself in private practice.
