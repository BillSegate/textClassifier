Codimg is software designed to provide objective video feedback, primarily in the fields of education, medical simulation and human resources.
Developed by the Spanish company Algifra in 2016, Codimg is available on Windows and as an iOS app.

Features
The main function of Codimg is to provide an analysis of common workplace and organisational scenarios through video. This video can either be streamed live to the software or pre-recorded and imported retrospectively.
The analysis is done through a digitised checklist containing buttons which can be clicked as needed whilst the scenario is being observed. This creates a short video clip which shows the piece of video which pertains to the checklist. Additional information can be added to the video through secondary buttons.
The video clips and data generated can then be analysed using tools in the software to obtain statistical data on scenarios. The most relevant video clips can be compiled into presentations and provide objective evidence in debriefings of scenarios.
