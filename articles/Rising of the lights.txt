Rising of the lights was an illness or obstructive condition of the larynx, trachea or lungs, possibly croup. It was a common entry on bills of mortality in the 17th century. Lights in this case referred to the lungs.

In culture
In his A New Booke of Mistakes (1637), Robert Chamberlain gives a humorous epitaph:

Of one Parkins a boone Companion in Essex who dyed of the rising of the Lights.
