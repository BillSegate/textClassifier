This is a list of disorders included in newborn screening programs around the world, along with information on testing methodologies, disease incidence and rationale for being included in screening programs.

American College of Medical Genetics recommendations

Classical galactosemia (GALT)  > 1 in 50,000Newborn screening by other methods than blood testing

Congenital deafness (HEAR) > 1 in 5,000

Secondary targets
The following disorders are additional conditions that may be detected by screening. Many are listed as "secondary targets" by the 2005 ACMG report. Some states are now screening for more than 50 congenital conditions. Many of these are rare and unfamiliar to pediatricians and other primary health care professionals.Blood cell disorders

Disorders added after the initial panel was defined
In addition to identifying a core list of disorders that infants in the United States should be screened for, the ACMG also established a framework for nominating future conditions, and the structure under which those conditions should be considered.

Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) - added in 2009
Critical congenital heart defects (Screened using pulse oximetry) - added in 2010
Pompe disease - added in 2013
Mucopolysaccharidosis type I - added in 2015
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy - added in 2018
Spinal muscular atrophy - added in 2018
