Adam Castillejo, also known as "The London Patient", is the second person known to have been cured of HIV infection. Castillejo, who is British-Venezuelan. and has mixed European ancestry, lives in London. He has previously  worked as a chef  and is now a motivational speaker.
His body became resistant to HIV infection after receiving a bone marrow transplant in 2016 to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma. The German donor carried the CCR5-Δ32 mutation which gives resistance from HIV infection. It is likely because of his half-Dutch father that Adam’s donor was compatible with him. He was treated by Professor Ravindra Gupta.
