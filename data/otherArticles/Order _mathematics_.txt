Logic
In logic, model theory and type theory:

Zeroth-order logic
First-order logic
Second-order logic
Higher-order logic

Order theory
Order (journal), an academic journal on order theory
Dense order, a total order wherein between any unequal pair of elements there is always an intervening element in the order
Glossary of order theory
Lexicographical order, an ordering method on sequences analogous to alphabetical order on words
List of order topics, list of order theory topics
Order theory, study of various binary relations known as orders
Order topology, a topology of total order for totally ordered sets
Ordinal numbers, numbers assigned to sets based on their set-theoretic order
Partial order, often called just "order" in order theory texts, a transitive antisymmetric relation
Total order, a partial order that is also total, in that either the relation or its inverse holds between any unequal elements

Statistics
Order statistics
First-order statistics, e.g., arithmetic mean, median, quantiles
