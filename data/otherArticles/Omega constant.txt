The omega constant is a mathematical constant defined as the unique real number that satisfies the equation

  
    
      
        Ω
        
          e
          
            Ω
          
        
        =
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega e^{\Omega }=1.}
  It is the value of W(1), where W is Lambert's W function.  The name is derived from the alternate name for Lambert's W function, the omega function. The numerical value of Ω is given by

Ω = 0.567143290409783872999968662210... (sequence A030178 in the OEIS).
1/Ω = 1.763222834351896710225201776951... (sequence A030797 in the OEIS).

Properties
Fixed point representation
The defining identity can be expressed, for example, as

  
    
      
        ln
        ⁡
        (
        
          
            
              1
              Ω
            
          
        
        )
        =
        Ω
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ln({\tfrac {1}{\Omega }})=\Omega .}
  or

  
    
      
        −
        ln
        ⁡
        (
        Ω
        )
        =
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle -\ln(\Omega )=\Omega }
  as well as

  
    
      
        
          e
          
            −
            Ω
          
        
        =
        Ω
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{-\Omega }=\Omega .}

Computation
One can calculate Ω iteratively, by starting with an initial guess Ω0, and considering the sequence

  
    
      
        
          Ω
          
            n
            +
            1
          
        
        =
        
          e
          
            −
            
              Ω
              
                n
              
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega _{n+1}=e^{-\Omega _{n}}.}
  This sequence will converge to Ω as n approaches infinity. This is because Ω is an attractive fixed point of the function e−x.
It is much more efficient to use the iteration

  
    
      
        
          Ω
          
            n
            +
            1
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              1
              +
              
                Ω
                
                  n
                
              
            
            
              1
              +
              
                e
                
                  
                    Ω
                    
                      n
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega _{n+1}={\frac {1+\Omega _{n}}{1+e^{\Omega _{n}}}},}
  because the function

  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          
            
              1
              +
              x
            
            
              1
              +
              
                e
                
                  x
                
              
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1+x}{1+e^{x}}},}
  in addition to having the same fixed point, also has a derivative that vanishes there. This guarantees quadratic convergence; that is, the number of correct digits is roughly doubled with each iteration.
Using Halley's method, Ω can be approximated with cubic convergence (the number of correct digits is roughly tripled with each iteration): (see also Lambert W function § Numerical evaluation).

  The latter two identities can be extended to other values of the W function (see also Lambert W function § Representations).

Transcendence
The constant Ω is transcendental. This can be seen as a direct consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem. For a contradiction, suppose that Ω is algebraic. By the theorem, e−Ω is transcendental, but Ω = e−Ω, which is a contradiction. Therefore, it must be transcendental.
