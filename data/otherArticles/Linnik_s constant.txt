Linnik's theorem in analytic number theory answers a natural question after Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. It asserts that there exist positive c and L such that, if we denote p(a,d) the least prime in the arithmetic progression

  
    
      
        a
        +
        n
        d
        ,
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle a+nd,\ }
  where n runs through the positive integers and a and d are any given positive coprime integers with 1 ≤ a ≤ d − 1, then:

  
    
      
        p
        ⁡
        (
        a
        ,
        d
        )
        <
        c
        
          d
          
            L
          
        
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {p} (a,d)<cd^{L}.\;}
  The theorem is named after Yuri Vladimirovich Linnik, who proved it in 1944. Although Linnik's proof showed c and L to be effectively computable, he provided no numerical values for them.
It follows from Zsigmondy's theorem that p(1,d) ≤ 2d − 1, for all d ≥ 3. It is known that p(1,p) ≤ Lp, for all primes p ≥ 5, as Lp is congruent to 1 modulo p for all prime numbers p, where Lp denotes the p-th Lucas number. Just like Mersenne numbers, Lucas numbers with prime indices have divisors of the form 2kp+1.

Properties
It is known that L ≤ 2 for almost all integers d.On the generalized Riemann hypothesis it can be shown that

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {p} (a,d)\leq (1+o(1))\varphi (d)^{2}(\log d)^{2}\;,}
  where

   is the totient function,
and the stronger bound

        d
        
          )

        log
        ⁡
        d
        
          )
          
            2
          
        
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {p} (a,d)\leq \varphi (d)^{2}(\log d)^{2}\;,}
  has been also proved.It is also conjectured that:

  
    
      
        p
        ⁡
        (
        a
        ,
        d
        )
        <
        
          d
          
            2
          
        
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {p} (a,d)<d^{2}.\;}

Bounds for L
The constant L is called Linnik's constant and the following table shows the progress that has been made on determining its size.

Moreover, in Heath-Brown's result the constant c is effectively computable.
