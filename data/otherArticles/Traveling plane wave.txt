In mathematics and physics, a traveling plane wave is a special case of plane wave, namely a field whose evolution in time can be described as simple translation of its values at a constant wave speed 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  , along a fixed direction of propagation 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              n
              →
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\vec {n}}}
  .
Such a field can be written as  

  
    
      
        F
        (
        
          
            
              x
              →
            
          
        
        ,
        t
        )
        =
        G
        
          (
          
            
              
                
                  x
                  →
                
              
            
            ⋅
            
              
                
                  n
                  →
                
              
            
            −
            c
            t
          
          )
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F({\vec {x}},t)=G\left({\vec {x}}\cdot {\vec {n}}-ct\right)\,}
  where 
  
    
      
        G
        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle G(u)}
   is a function of a single real parameter 
  
    
      
        u
        =
        d
        −
        c
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle u=d-ct}
  .  The function 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
   describes the profile of the wave, namely the value of the field at time 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=0}
  , for each displacement 
  
    
      
        d
        =
        
          
            
              x
              →
            
          
        
        ⋅
        
          
            
              n
              →
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle d={\vec {x}}\cdot {\vec {n}}}
  .  For each displacement 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  , the moving plane perpendicular to 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              n
              →
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\vec {n}}}
   at distance 
  
    
      
        d
        +
        c
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle d+ct}
   from the origin is called a wavefront.  This plane too travels along the direction of propagation 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              n
              →
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\vec {n}}}
   with velocity 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  ; and the value of the field is then the same, and constant in time, at every one of its points.
The wave 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   may be a scalar or vector field; its values are the values of 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  .
A sinusoidal plane wave is a special case, when 
  
    
      
        G
        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle G(u)}
   is a sinusoidal function of 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
  .

Properties
A traveling plane wave can be studied by ignoring the dimensions of space perpendicular to the vector  
  
    
      
        
          
            
              n
              →
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\vec {n}}}
  ; that is, by considering the wave 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        z
        
          
            
              n
              →
            
          
        
        ,
        t
        )
        =
        G
        (
        z
        −
        c
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(z{\vec {n}},t)=G(z-ct)}
   on a one-dimensional medium, with a single position coordinate 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
  .
For a scalar traveling plane wave in two or three dimensions, the gradient of the field is always collinear with the direction 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              n
              →
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\vec {n}}}
  ; specifically, 
  
    
      
        ∇
        F
        (
        
          
            
              x
              →
            
          
        
        ,
        t
        )
        =
        
          
            
              n
              →
            
          
        
        
          G
          ′
        
        (
        
          
            
              x
              →
            
          
        
        ⋅
        
          
            
              n
              →
            
          
        
        −
        c
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nabla F({\vec {x}},t)={\vec {n}}G'({\vec {x}}\cdot {\vec {n}}-ct)}
  , where 
  
    
      
        
          G
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle G'}
   is the derivative of 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  .   Moreover, a traveling plane wave 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   of any shape satisfies the partial differential equation

  
    
      
        ∇
        F
        =
        −
        
          
            
              
                n
                →
              
            
            c
          
        
        
          
            
              ∂
              F
            
            
              ∂
              t
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nabla F=-{\frac {\vec {n}}{c}}{\frac {\partial F}{\partial t}}}
  Plane traveling waves are also special solutions of the wave equation in an homogeneous medium.
