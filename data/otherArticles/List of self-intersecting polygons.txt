Self-intersecting polygons, crossed polygons, or self-crossing polygons are polygons some of whose edges cross each other. They contrast with simple polygons, whose edges never cross. 
Some types of self-intersecting polygons are:

the crossed quadrilateral, with four edges
the antiparallelogram, a crossed quadrilateral with alternate edges of equal length
the crossed rectangle, an antiparallelogram whose edges are two opposite sides and the two diagonals of a rectangle, hence having two edges parallel
