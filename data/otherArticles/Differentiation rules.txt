This is a summary of differentiation rules, that is, rules for computing the derivative of a function in calculus.

Elementary rules of differentiation
Unless otherwise stated, all functions are functions of real numbers (R) that return real values; although more generally, the formulae below apply wherever they are well defined — including the case of complex numbers (C).

Constant term rule
For any value of 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  , where 
  
    
      
        c
        ∈
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\in \mathbb {R} }
  , if 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)}
   is the constant function given by 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=c}
  , then 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
              f
            
            
              d
              x
            
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {df}{dx}}=0}
  .

Proof
Let 
  
    
      
        c
        ∈
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\in \mathbb {R} }
   and 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=c}
  . By the definition of the derivative,

                x
                )

                    h

                    h
                  
                
              
            
            
              
              
                
                =
                
                  lim

                    0
                    h
                  
                
              
            
            
              
              
                
                =
                
                  lim
                  
                    h
                    →
                    0
                  
                
                0
              
            
            
              
              
                
                =
                0
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f'(x)&=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}}\\&=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {(c)-(c)}{h}}\\&=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {0}{h}}\\&=\lim _{h\to 0}0\\&=0\end{aligned}}}
  This shows that the derivative of any constant function is 0.

Intuitive (geometric) explanation
The derivative of the function at a point is the slope of the line tangent to the curve at the point. Slope of the constant function is zero, because the tangent line to the constant function is horizontal and it's angle is zero.
In other words, the value of the constant function, y, will not change as the value of x increases or decreases.

Differentiation is linear
For any functions 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   and 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   and any real numbers 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  , the derivative of the function 
  
    
      
        h
        (
        x
        )
        =
        a
        f
        (
        x
        )
        +
        b
        g
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(x)=af(x)+bg(x)}
   with respect to 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is: 
  
    
      
        
          h
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        a
        
          f
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        +
        b
        
          g
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h'(x)=af'(x)+bg'(x).}
  
In Leibniz's notation this is written as:

Special cases include:

The constant factor rule 
The sum rule

For the functions f and g, the derivative of the function h(x) = f(x) g(x) with respect to x is

In Leibniz's notation this is written

The chain rule
The derivative of the function 
  
    
      
        h
        (
        x
        )
        =
        f
        (
        g
        (
        x
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(x)=f(g(x))}
   is

In Leibniz's notation, this is written as:

Focusing on the notion of maps, and the differential being a map 
  
    
      
        
          D
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{D}}}
  , this is written in a more concise way as:

The inverse function rule
If the function f has an inverse function g, meaning that 
  
    
      
        g
        (
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(f(x))=x}
   and 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        g
        (
        y
        )
        )
        =
        y
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(g(y))=y,}
   then

In Leibniz notation, this is written as

Power laws, polynomials, quotients, and reciprocals
The polynomial or elementary power rule
If 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          x
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{r}}
  , for any real number 
  
    
      
        r
        ≠
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle r\neq 0,}
   then 

  
    
      
        
          f
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        r

    {\displaystyle f'(x)=rx^{r-1}.}
  When 
  
    
      
        r
        =
        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle r=1,}
   this becomes the special case that if 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=x,}
   then 
  
    
      
        
          f
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle f'(x)=1.}
  
Combining the power rule with the sum and constant multiple rules permits the computation of the derivative of any polynomial.

The reciprocal rule
The derivative of 
  
    
      
        h
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          
            1
            
              f
              (
              x
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(x)={\frac {1}{f(x)}}}
  for any (nonvanishing) function f is:

  
    
      
        
          h
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        −
        
          
            
              
                f
                ′
              
              (
              x
              )
            
            
              (
              f
              (
              x
              )
              
                )
                
                  2
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h'(x)=-{\frac {f'(x)}{(f(x))^{2}}}}
   wherever f is non-zero.In Leibniz's notation, this is written

  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
              (
              1
              
                /
              
              f
              )
            
            
              d
              x
            
          
        
        =
        −
        
          
            1
            
              f
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        
          
            
              d
              f
            
            
              d
              x
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {d(1/f)}{dx}}=-{\frac {1}{f^{2}}}{\frac {df}{dx}}.}
  The reciprocal rule can be derived either from the quotient rule, or from the combination of power rule and chain rule.

The quotient rule
If f and g are functions, then:

  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              
                f
                g
              
            
            )
          
          ′
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                f
                ′
              
              g
              −
              
                g
                ′
              
              f
            
            
              g
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left({\frac {f}{g}}\right)'={\frac {f'g-g'f}{g^{2}}}\quad }
   wherever g is nonzero.This can be derived from the product rule and the reciprocal rule.

Generalized power rule
The elementary power rule generalizes considerably. The most general power rule is the functional power rule: for any functions f and g,

  
    
      
        (
        
          f
          
            g
          
        
        
          )
          ′
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              e
              
                g
                ln

Logarithmic derivatives
The logarithmic derivative is another way of stating the rule for differentiating the logarithm of a function (using the chain rule):

  
    
      
        (
        ln
        ⁡
        f
        
          )
          ′
        
        =
        
          
            
              f
              ′
            
            f
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\ln f)'={\frac {f'}{f}}\quad }
   wherever f is positive.Logarithmic differentiation is a technique which uses logarithms and its differentiation rules to simplify certain expressions before actually applying the derivative.Logarithms can be used to remove exponents, convert products into sums, and convert division into subtraction — each of which may lead to a simplified expression for taking derivatives.

Derivatives of trigonometric functions
The derivatives in the table above are for when the range of the inverse secant is 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        π
        ]
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,\pi ]\!}
   and when the range of the inverse cosecant is 
  
    
      
        
          [
          
            −

    {\displaystyle \left[-{\frac {\pi }{2}},{\frac {\pi }{2}}\right]\!}
  .
It is common to additionally define an inverse tangent function with two arguments, 
  
    
      
        arctan
        ⁡
        (
        y
        ,
        x
        )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \arctan(y,x)\!}
  .  Its value lies in the range 
  
    
      
        [
        −
        π
        ,
        π
        ]
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle [-\pi ,\pi ]\!}
   and reflects the quadrant of the point 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,y)\!}
  .  For the first and fourth quadrant (i.e. 
  
    
      
        x
        >
        0
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x>0\!}
  ) one has 
  
    
      
        arctan
        ⁡
        (
        y
        ,
        x
        >
        0
        )
        =
        arctan
        ⁡
        (
        y
        
          /
        
        x
        )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \arctan(y,x>0)=\arctan(y/x)\!}
  .  Its partial derivatives are
