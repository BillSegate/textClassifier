A "hat" (circumflex (ˆ)), placed over a symbol is a mathematical notation with various uses.

Estimated value
In statistics, a circumflex (ˆ), called a "hat", is used to denote an estimator or an estimated value. For example, in the context of errors and residuals, the "hat" over the letter 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              ε
              ^
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {\varepsilon }}}
   indicates an observable estimate (the residuals) of an unobservable quantity called 
  
    
      
        ε
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varepsilon }
   (the statistical errors).
Another example of the hat operator denoting an estimator occurs in simple linear regression. Assuming a model of

Hat matrix
In statistics, the hat matrix H projects the observed values y of response variable to the predicted values ŷ: 

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                y
              
              ^
            
          
        
        =
        H
        
          y
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {y} }}=H\mathbf {y} .}

Cross product
In screw theory, one use of the hat operator is to represent the cross product operation.  Since the cross product is a linear transformation, it can be represented as a matrix.  The hat operator takes a vector and transforms it into its equivalent matrix.

Unit vector
In mathematics, a unit vector in a normed vector space is a vector (often a spatial vector) of length 1. A unit vector is often denoted by a lowercase letter with a circumflex, or "hat", as in 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                v
              
              ^
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {v} }}}
   (pronounced "v-hat").

Fourier transform
The Fourier transform of a function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is traditionally denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              f
              ^
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {f}}}
  .
