Feller's coin-tossing constants are a set of numerical constants which describe asymptotic probabilities that in n independent tosses of a fair coin, no run of k consecutive heads (or, equally, tails) appears.
William Feller showed that if this probability is written as p(n,k) then

  where αk is the smallest positive real root of

Values of the constants
For 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=2}
   the constants are related to the golden ratio, 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
  , and Fibonacci numbers; the constants are

  . The exact probability p(n,2) can be calculated either by using Fibonacci numbers, p(n,2) =

        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  , the constants are related to generalizations of Fibonacci numbers such as the tribonacci and tetranacci numbers. The corresponding exact probabilities can be calculated as p(n,k) =

                  k
                  )

    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {F_{n+2}^{(k)}}{2^{n}}}}
  .

Example
If we toss a fair coin ten times then the exact probability that no pair of heads come up in succession (i.e. n = 10 and k = 2) is p(10,2) = 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              9
              64
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {9}{64}}}
   = 0.140625. The approximation

        ≈
        
          β
          
            k
          
        
        
          /
        
        
          α
          
            k
          
          
            n
            +
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(n,k)\approx \beta _{k}/\alpha _{k}^{n+1}}
   gives 1.44721356...×1.23606797...−11 = 0.1406263...
