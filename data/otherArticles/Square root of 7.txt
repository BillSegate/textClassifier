The square root of 7 is the positive real number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the prime number 7. It is more precisely called the principal square root of 7, to distinguish it from the negative number with the same property. This number appears in various geometric and number-theoretic contexts. It can be denoted in surd form as:

  
    
      
        
          
            7
          
        
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {7}}\,,}
  and in exponent form as:

  
    
      
        
          7
          
            
              1
              2
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle 7^{\frac {1}{2}}.}
  It is an irrational algebraic number.  The first sixty significant digits of its decimal expansion are:

2.64575131106459059050161575363926042571025918308245018036833....which can be rounded up to 2.646 to within about 99.99% accuracy (about 1 part in 10000); that is, it differs from the correct value by about 1/4,000.  The approximation 127/48 (≈ 2.645833...) is better: despite having a denominator of only 48, it differs from the correct value by less than 1/12,000, or less than one part in 33,000. 
More than a million decimal digits of the square root of seven have been published.

Rational approximations
The extraction of decimal-fraction approximations to square roots by various methods has used the square root of 7 as an example or exercise in textbooks, for hundreds of years.  Different numbers of digits after the decimal point are shown: 5 in 1773 and 1852, 3 in 1835, 6 in 1808, and 7 in 1797.
An extraction by Newton's method (approximately) was illustrated in 1922, concluding that it is 2.646 "to the nearest thousandth".For a family of good rational approximations, the square root of 7 can be expressed as the continued fraction

Geometry
In plane geometry, the square root of 7 can be constructed via a sequence of dynamic rectangles, that is, as the largest diagonal of those rectangles illustrated here.The minimal enclosing rectangle of an equilateral triangle of edge length 2 has a diagonal of the square root of 7.Due to the Pythagorean theorem and Legendre's three-square theorem, 
  
    
      
        
          
            7
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {7}}}
   is the smallest square root of a natural number that cannot be the distance between any two points of a cubic integer lattice (or equivalently, the length of the space diagonal of a rectangular cuboid with integer side lengths). 
  
    
      
        
          
            15
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {15}}}
   is the next smallest such number.

Outside of mathematics
On the reverse of the current US one-dollar bill, the "large inner box" has a length-to-width ratio of the square root of 7, and a diagonal of 6.0 inches, to within measurement accuracy.
