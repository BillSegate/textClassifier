In mathematics and computer science, an event structure represents a set of events, some of which can only be performed after another (there is a dependency between the events) and some of which might not be performed together (there is a conflict between the events).

Formal definition
An event structure 
  
    
      
        (
        E
        ,
        ≤
        ,
        #
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (E,\leq ,\#)}
   consists of

a set 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   of events
a partial order relation on 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   called causal dependency,
an irreflexive symmetric relation 
  
    
      
        #
      
    
    {\displaystyle \#}
   called incompatibility (or conflict)such that

finite causes: for every event 
  
    
      
        e
        ∈
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle e\in E}
  , the set 
  
    
      
        [
        e
        ]
        =
        {
        f
        ∈
        E
        ∣
        f
        ≤
        e
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle [e]=\{f\in E\mid f\leq e\}}
   of predecessors of 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   in 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   is finite
hereditary conflict: for every events 
  
    
      
        d
        ,
        e
        ,
        f
        ∈
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle d,e,f\in E}
  , if 
  
    
      
        d
        ≤
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\leq e}
   and 
  
    
      
        d
        #
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\#f}
   then 
  
    
      
        e
        #
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle e\#f}
  .
