MatheAss (former Math-Assist) is a computer program for numerical solutions in school mathematics and functions in some points similar to Microsoft Mathematics. "MatheAss is widely spread in math classes" in Germany. For schools in the federal state of Hessen (Germany) exists a state license, which allows all secondary schools to use MatheAssIts functionality is limited compared to other numerical programs, for example, MatheAss has no script language and does no symbolic computation. On the other side it is easy to use and offers the user fully worked out solutions, in which only the necessary quantities need to be entered. MatheAss covers the topics algebra, geometry, analysis, stochastics, and linear algebra.After a precursor for the home computers, usual around 1980, MatheAss appeared in 1983 as a shareware version for the PC, so it was one of the first shareware programs on the German market. MatheAss is available on the manufacturer's website for download for various versions of the Windows operating system.Since version 8.2 (released in February 2011) MatheAss again offers a context-sensitive help, which was supplemented in many places by showing mathematical examples and background information. The MatheAss help file can also be viewed online.
