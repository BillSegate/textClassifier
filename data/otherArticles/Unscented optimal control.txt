In mathematics, unscented optimal control combines the notion of the unscented transform with deterministic optimal control to address a class of uncertain optimal control problems. It is a specific application of Riemmann-Stieltjes optimal control theory, a concept introduced by Ross and his coworkers.

Mathematical description
Suppose that the initial state 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{0}}
   of a dynamical system,

  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ˙
            
          
        
        =
        f
        (
        x
        ,
        u
        ,
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\dot {x}}=f(x,u,t)}
  
is an uncertain quantity.  Let 
  
    
      
        
          
            X
          
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {X} ^{i}}
   be the sigma points.  Then sigma-copies of the dynamical system are given by,

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  X
                
                ˙
              
            
          
          
            i
          
        
        =
        f
        (
        
          
            X
          
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        u
        ,
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\dot {\mathrm {X} }}^{i}=f(\mathrm {X} ^{i},u,t)}
  
Applying standard deterministic optimal control principles to this ensemble generates an unscented optimal control. Unscented optimal control is a special case of tychastic optimal control theory.  According to Aubin and Ross, tychastic processes differ from stochastic processes in that a tychastic process is conditionally deterministic.

Applications
Unscented optimal control theory has been applied to UAV guidance, spacecraft attitude control, air-traffic control and low-thrust trajectory optimization
