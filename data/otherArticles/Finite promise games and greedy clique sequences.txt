The finite promise games are a collection of mathematical games developed by American mathematician Harvey Friedman in 2009 which are used to develop a family of fast-growing functions

Finite promise games
Each of the games is finite, predetermined in length, and has two players (Alice and Bob). At each turn, Alice chooses an integer or a number of integers (an offering) and the Bob has to make one of two kinds of promises restricting his future possible moves. In all games, Bob wins if and only if Bob has kept all of his promises.

Finite piecewise linear copy/invert games
Here, 
  
    
      
        
          Z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }
   is the set of integers, and 
  
    
      
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }
   is the set of non-negative integers. Here, all letters represent integers. We say that a map 
  
    
      
        T
        :
        
          
            N

        →
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T:\mathbb {N} ^{k}\rightarrow \mathbb {N} }
   is piecewise linear if 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   can be defined by various affine functions with integer coefficients on each of finitely many pieces, where each piece is defined by a finite set of linear inequalities with integer coefficients. For some piecewise linear map 
  
    
      
        T
        :

        ,
        …
        ,
        
          y
          
            k
          
        
        <
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle y_{1},\ldots ,y_{k}<x}
   such that 
  
    
      
        T
        (
        
          y

        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle T(y_{1},\ldots ,y_{k})=x}
  . We then define the game 
  
    
      
        G
        (
        T
        ,
        n
        ,
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle G(T,n,s)}
   for nonzero 
  
    
      
        n
        ,
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle n,s}
  .

    {\displaystyle G(T,n,s)}
   has 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   rounds, and alternates between Alice and Bob. At every stage of the game, Alice is required to play 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        [
        0
        ,

  , called her offering, which is either of the form 
  
    
      
        y
        +
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle y+z}
   or 
  
    
      
        w

   and 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   are integers previously played by Bob. Bob is then required to either:

Accept 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , thereby playing 
  
    
      
        x

   and promising that there will be no

  -inversion of 
  
    
      
        x

   among the integers ever played by Bob. This promise applies to all past, present and future plays in the game.
Reject 
  
    
      
        x
