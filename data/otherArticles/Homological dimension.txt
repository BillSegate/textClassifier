Projective dimension of a module, based on projective resolutions
Injective dimension of a module, based on injective resolutions
Weak dimension of a module, or flat dimension, based on flat resolutions
Weak global dimension of a ring, based on the weak dimension of its modules
Cohomological dimension of a group
