In vector calculus, a vector potential is a vector field whose curl is a given vector field. This is analogous to a scalar potential, which is a scalar field whose gradient is a given vector field.
Formally, given a vector field v, a vector potential is a

   vector field A such that

Consequence
If a vector field v admits a vector potential A, then from the equality 

(divergence of the curl is zero) one obtains

which implies that v must be a solenoidal vector field.

Theorem
Let 

be a solenoidal vector field which is twice continuously differentiable. Assume that v(x) decreases at least as fast as

Define

Then, A is a vector potential for v, that is,　
Here, 
  
    
      
        
          ∇
          
            y
          
        
        ×
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nabla _{y}\times }
   is curl for variable y.
Substituting curl[v] for the current density j of the retarded potential, you will get this formula. In other words, v corresponds to the H-field.
You can restrict the integral domain to any single-connected region Ω. That is, A' below is also a vector potential of v;

A generalization of this theorem is the Helmholtz decomposition which states that any vector field can be decomposed as a sum of a solenoidal vector field and an irrotational vector field.
By analogy with Biot-Savart's law, the following

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {A''}}({\textbf {x}})}
   is also qualify as a vector potential for v.

  Substitute j (current density) for v and H (H-field)for A, we will find the  Biot-Savart law.

Nonuniqueness
The vector potential admitted by a solenoidal field is not unique.  If A is a vector potential for v, then so is

where 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is any continuously differentiable scalar function. This follows from the fact that the curl of the gradient is zero.
This nonuniqueness leads to a degree of freedom in the formulation of electrodynamics, or gauge freedom, and requires choosing a gauge.
