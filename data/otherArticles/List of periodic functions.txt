This is a list of some well-known periodic functions. The constant function f (x) = c, where c is independent of x, is periodic with any period, but lacks a fundamental period. A definition is given for some of the following functions, though each function may have many equivalent definitions.

Smooth functions
All trigonometric functions listed have period 
  
    
      
        2
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2\pi }
  , unless otherwise stated. For the following trigonometric functions:

Un is the nth up/down number,
Bn is the nth Bernoulli number
in Jacobi elliptic functions, 
  
    
      
        q
        =
        
          e
          
            −
            π
            
              
                
                  K
                  (
                  1
                  −
                  m
                  )
                
                
                  K
                  (
                  m
                  )
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle q=e^{-\pi {\frac {K(1-m)}{K(m)}}}}

Non-smooth functions
The following functions have period 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   and take 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   as their argument. The symbol 
  
    
      
        ⌊
        n
        ⌋
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lfloor n\rfloor }
   is the floor function of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   and 
  
    
      
        sgn
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {sgn} }
   is the sign function.
