A discontinuous group is a mathematical concept relating to mappings in topological space.

Definition
Let 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   be a topological space of points 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
  , and let 
  
    
      
        τ
        →
        f
        (
        τ
        ,
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau \to f(\tau ,x)}
  , 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in G}
  , be an open continuous representation of the topological group 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
   as a transitive group of homeomorphic mappings of 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   on itself. The representation 
  
    
      
        τ
        →
        f
        (
        τ
        ,
        a
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau \to f(\tau ,a)}
   
  
    
      
        a
        ∈
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\in H}
   of the discrete subgroup 
  
    
      
        H
        ⊂
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle H\subset G}
   in 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   is called discontinuous, if no sequence 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        τ
        ,
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(\tau ,a_{n})}
   (
  
    
      
        n
        =
        1
        ,
        2
        ,
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=1,2,\ldots }
  ) converges to a point in 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
  , as 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{n}}
   runs over distinct elements of 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
  .
