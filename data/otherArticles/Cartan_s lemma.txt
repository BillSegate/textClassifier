In mathematics, Cartan's lemma refers to a number of results named after either Élie Cartan or his son Henri Cartan:

In exterior algebra: Suppose that v1, ..., vp are linearly independent elements of a vector space V and w1, ..., wp are such that
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            1
          
        
        ∧
        
          w
          
            1
          
        
        +
        ⋯
        +
        
          v
          
            p
          
        
        ∧
        
          w
          
            p
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle v_{1}\wedge w_{1}+\cdots +v_{p}\wedge w_{p}=0}
  
in ΛV.  Then there are scalars hij = hji such that

  
    
      
        
          w
          
            i
          
        
        =

            =
