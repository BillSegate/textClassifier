In mathematical analysis, the Foias constant is a real number named after Ciprian Foias.
It is defined in the following way: for every real number x1 > 0, there is a sequence defined by the recurrence relation

  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
            +
            1
          
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              1
              +
              
                
                  1
                  
                    x
                    
                      n
                    
                  
                
              
            
            )
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{n+1}=\left(1+{\frac {1}{x_{n}}}\right)^{n}}
  for n = 1, 2, 3, ....  The Foias constant is the unique choice α such that if x1 = α then the sequence diverges to infinity.  For all other values of x1, the sequence is divergent as well, but it has two accumulation points: 1 and infinity.  Numerically, it is

  
    
      
        α
        =
        1.187452351126501
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha =1.187452351126501\ldots }
  .No closed form for the constant is known.
When x1 = α then the growth rate of the sequence (xn) is given by the limit

  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            n
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        
          
            
              log
              ⁡
              n
            
            n
          
        
        =
        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }x_{n}{\frac {\log n}{n}}=1,}
  where "log" denotes the natural logarithm.The same methods used in the proof of the uniqueness of the Foias constant may also be applied to other similar recursive sequences.
