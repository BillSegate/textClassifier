Halanay inequality is a comparison theorem for differential equations with delay. This inequality and its generalizations have been applied to analyze the stability of delayed differential equations, and in particular, the stability of industrial processes with dead-time and delayed neural networks.

Statement
Let 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{0}}
   be a real number and 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   be a non-negative number. If 
  
    
      
        v
        :
        [
        
          t
          
            0
          
        
        −
        τ
        ,
        ∞
        )
        →
        
          
            R
          
          
            +
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v:[t_{0}-\tau ,\infty )\rightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{+}}
   satisfies 

where 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   and 
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
   are constants with 
  
    
      
        α
        >
        β
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha >\beta >0}
  , then 

where 
  
    
      
        k
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle k>0}
   and 
  
    
      
        η
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \eta >0}
  .
