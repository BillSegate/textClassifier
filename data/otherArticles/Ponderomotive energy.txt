In strong-field laser physics, ponderomotive energy is the cycle-averaged quiver energy of a free electron in an electromagnetic field.

In terms of the laser intensity

For typical orders of magnitudes involved in laser physics, this becomes:

    {\displaystyle U_{p}(\mathrm {eV} )=9.33\cdot I(10^{14}\mathrm {W/cm} ^{2})\cdot \lambda (\mathrm {\mu m} )^{2}}
  ,where the laser wavelength is

  , and 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   is the speed of light. The units are electronvolts (eV), watts (W), centimeters (cm) and micrometers (μm).

Atomic units
In atomic units, 
  
    
      
        e
        =
        m
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle e=m=1}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          ϵ

        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon _{0}=1/4\pi }
  , 
  
    
      
        α
        c
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha c=1}
   where 
  
    
      
        α
        ≈
        1
        
          /
        
        137
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha \approx 1/137}
  . If one uses the atomic unit of electric field, then the ponderomotive energy is just

  
    
      
        
          U

    {\displaystyle U_{p}={\frac {E^{2}}{4\omega _{0}^{2}}}.}

Derivation
The formula for the ponderomotive energy can be easily derived. A free particle of charge

  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
   interacts with an electric field 
  
    
      
        E
        
        cos
        ⁡
        (
        ω
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle E\,\cos(\omega t)}
  . The force on the charged particle is 

  
    
      
        F
        =
        q
        E
        
        cos
        ⁡
        (
        ω
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle F=qE\,\cos(\omega t)}
  .The acceleration of the particle is 

  
    
      
        
          a
          
            m
          
        
        =
        
          
            F
            m
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              q
              E
            
            m
          
        
        cos
        ⁡

        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{m}={F \over m}={qE \over m}\cos(\omega t)}
