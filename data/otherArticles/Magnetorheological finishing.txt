Magnetorheological finishing (MRF) is a precision surface finishing technology. Optical surfaces are polished in a computer-controlled magnetorheological (MR) finishing slurry. Unlike conventional rigid lap polishing, the MR fluid's shape and stiffness can be magnetically manipulated and controlled in real time. The optic's final surface form and finishing results are predicted through the use of computer algorithms.
