In the study of the arithmetic of elliptic curves, the j-line over a ring R is the coarse moduli scheme attached to the moduli problem sending a ring 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   to the set of isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  . Since elliptic curves over the complex numbers are isomorphic (over an algebraic closure) if and only if their 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
  -invariants agree, the affine space 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
          
            j
          
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {A} _{j}^{1}}
   parameterizing j-invariants of elliptic curves yields a coarse moduli space. However, this fails to be a fine moduli space due to the presence of elliptic curves with automorphisms, necessitating the construction of the Moduli stack of elliptic curves.
This is related to the congruence subgroup 
  
    
      
        Γ
        (
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma (1)}
   in the following way:

  
    
      
        M
        (
        [
        Γ
        (
        1
        )
        ]
        )
        =
        
          S
          p
          e
          c
        
        (
        R
        [
        j
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle M([\Gamma (1)])=\mathrm {Spec} (R[j])}
  Here the j-invariant is normalized such that 
  
    
      
        j
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle j=0}
   has complex multiplication by 
  
    
      
        
          Z
        
        [
        
          ζ
          
            3
          
        
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [\zeta _{3}]}
  , and 
  
    
      
        j
        =
        1728
      
    
    {\displaystyle j=1728}
   has complex multiplication by 
  
    
      
        
          Z
        
        [
        i
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [i]}
  .
The j-line can be seen as giving a coordinatization of the classical modular curve of level 1, 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            0
          
        
        (
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{0}(1)}
  , which is isomorphic to the complex projective line 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
          
          
            
              /
            
            
              C
            
          
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} _{/\mathbb {C} }^{1}}
  .
