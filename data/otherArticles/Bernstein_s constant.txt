Bernstein's constant, usually denoted by the Greek letter β (beta), is a mathematical constant named after Sergei Natanovich Bernstein and is equal to 0.2801694990... .

Definition
Let En(ƒ) be the error of the best uniform approximation to a real function ƒ(x) on the interval [−1, 1] by real polynomials of no more than degree n. In the case of ƒ(x) = |x|, Bernstein showed that the limit 

  
    
      
        β
        =
        
          lim

  called Bernstein's constant, exists and is between 0.278 and 0.286. His conjecture that the limit is:

  
    
      
        
          
            1

        =
        0.28209
        …
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2{\sqrt {\pi }}}}=0.28209\dots \,.}
  was disproven by Varga and Carpenter, who calculated 

  
    
      
        β
        =
        0.280169499023
        …
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta =0.280169499023\dots \,.}
