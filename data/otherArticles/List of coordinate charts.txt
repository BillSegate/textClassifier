This article contains a non-exhaustive list of coordinate charts for Riemannian manifolds and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. Coordinate charts are mathematical objects of topological manifolds, and they have multiple applications in theoretical and applied mathematics. When a differentiable structure and a metric are defined, greater structure exists, and this allows the definition of constructs such as integration and geodesics.
