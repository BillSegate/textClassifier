In combustion physics, fuel mass fraction is the ratio of fuel mass flow to the total mass flow of a fuel mixture. If an air flow is fuel free, the fuel mass fraction is zero; in pure fuel without trapped gases, the ratio is unity. As fuel is burned in a combustion process, the fuel mass fraction is reduced. The definition reads as

  
    
      
        
          Y
          
            F
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              m
              
                F
              
            
            
              m
              
                
                  t
                  o
                  t
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y_{F}={\frac {m_{F}}{m_{\rm {tot}}}}}
  where 

  
    
      
        
          m
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle m_{F}}
   is the mass of the fuel in the mixture

              t
              o
              t
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle m_{\rm {tot}}}
   is the total mass of the mixture
