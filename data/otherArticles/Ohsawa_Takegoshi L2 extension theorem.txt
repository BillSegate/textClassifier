In several complex variables, the Ohsawa–Takegoshi L2 extension theorem is a fundamental result concerning the holomorphic extension of an

It was discovered by Takeo Ohsawa and Kensho Takegoshi in 1987, using what have been described as ad hoc methods involving twisted Laplace–Beltrami operators, but simpler proofs have since been discovered. Many generalizations and similar results exist, and are known as theorems of Ohsawa–Takegoshi type.
