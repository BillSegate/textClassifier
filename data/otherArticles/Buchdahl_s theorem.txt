In general relativity, Buchdahl's theorem, named after Hans Adolf Buchdahl, makes more precise the notion that there is a maximal sustainable density for ordinary gravitating matter. It gives an inequality between the mass and radius that must be satisfied for static, spherically symmetric matter configurations under certain conditions. In particular, for areal radius 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  , the mass 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
   must satisfy

where  
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
   is the gravitational constant and  
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   is the speed of light. This inequality is often referred to as Buchdahl's bound. The bound has historically also been called Schwarzschild's limit as it was first noted by Karl Schwarzschild to exist in the special case of a constant density fluid. However, this terminology should not be confused with the Schwarzschild radius which is notably smaller than the radius at the Buchdahl bound.

For his proof of the theorem, Buchdahl uses the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation.

Significance
The Buchdahl theorem is useful when looking for alternatives to black holes. Such attempts are often inspired by the information paradox; a way to explain (part of) the dark matter; or to criticize that observations of black holes are based on excluding known astrophysical alternatives (such as neutron stars) rather than direct evidence. However, to provide a viable alternative it is sometimes needed that the object should be extremely compact and in particular violate the Buchdahl inequality. This implies that one of the assumptions of Buchdahl's theorem must be invalid. A classification scheme can be made based on which assumptions are violated.

Extensions
Extensions to Buchdahl's theorem generally either relax assumptions on the matter or on the symmetry of the problem. For instance, by introducing anisotropic matter  or rotation. In addition one can also consider analogues of Buchdahl's theorem in other theories of gravity
