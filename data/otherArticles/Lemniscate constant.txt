In mathematics, the lemniscate constant ϖ is a transcendental mathematical constant that is the ratio of the perimeter of Bernoulli's lemniscate to its diameter, analogous to the definition of π for the circle. Equivalently, the perimeter of the lemniscate

   is 2ϖ. The lemniscate constant is closely related to the lemniscate elliptic functions and approximately equal to 2.62205755. The symbol ϖ is a cursive variant of π; see Pi § Variant pi.
Gauss's constant, denoted by G, is equal to ϖ /π ≈ 0.8346268.John Todd named two more lemniscate constants, the first lemniscate constant A = ϖ/2 ≈ 1.3110287771 and the second lemniscate constant B = π/(2ϖ) ≈ 0.5990701173.Sometimes the quantities 2ϖ or A are referred to as the lemniscate constant.

History
Gauss's constant 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
   is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who calculated it via the arithmetic–geometric mean as

          /

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1/M(1,{\sqrt {2}})}
  . By 1799, Gauss had two proofs of the theorem that

   where 
  
    
      
        ϖ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varpi }
   is the lemniscate constant.The lemniscate constant

   and first lemniscate constant

    {\displaystyle A}
   were proven transcendental by Theodor Schneider in 1937 and the second lemniscate constant 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   and Gauss's constant

   were proven transcendental by Theodor Schneider in 1941. In 1975, Gregory Chudnovsky proved that the set

          Q

  , which implies that

   and

Forms
Usually,
