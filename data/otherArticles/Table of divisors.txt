The tables below list all of the divisors of the numbers 1 to 1000.
A divisor of an integer n is an integer m, for which n/m is again an integer (which is necessarily also a divisor of n). For example, 3 is a divisor of 21, since 21/7 = 3 (and therefore 7 is also a divisor of 21).
If m is a divisor of n then so is −m. The tables below only list positive divisors.

Key to the tables
d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n, including 1 and n itself
 σ(n) is the sum of the positive divisors of n, including 1 and n itself
 s(n) is the sum of the proper divisors of n, including 1, but not n itself; that is,  s(n) = σ(n) − n
a deficient number is greater than the sum of its proper divisors; that is, s(n) < n
a perfect number equals the sum of its proper divisors; that is, s(n) = n
an abundant number is lesser than the sum of its proper divisors; that is, s(n) > n
a highly abundant number has a sum of positive divisors greater than any lesser number's sum of positive divisors; that is, s(n) > s(m) for every positive integer m < n. Counterintuitively, the first seven highly abundant numbers are not abundant numbers.
a prime number has only 1 and itself as divisors; that is, d(n) = 2.  Prime numbers are always deficient as s(n)=1.
a composite number has more than just 1 and itself as divisors; that is, d(n) > 2
a highly composite number has more divisors than any lesser number; that is, d(n) > d(m) for every positive integer m < n. Counterintuitively, the first two highly composite numbers are not composite numbers.
a superior highly composite number has more divisors than any other number scaled relative to some positive power of the number itself; that is, there exists some ε such that

a weird number is an abundant number that is not semiperfect; that is, no subset of the proper divisors of n sum to n
