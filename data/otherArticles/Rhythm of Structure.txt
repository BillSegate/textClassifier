Rhythm of Structure is a multimedia interdisciplinary project founded in 2003. It features a series of exhibitions, performances, and academic projects that explore the interconnecting structures and process of mathematics and art, and language, as way to advance a movement of mathematical expression across the arts, across creative collaborative communities celebrating the rhythm and patterns of both ideas of the mind and the physical reality of nature.

Introduction
Rhythm of Structure, as an expanding series of art exhibitions, performances, videos/films and publications created and curated by multimedia mathematical artist and writer John Sims, explores and celebrates the intersecting structures of mathematics, art, community, and nature. Sims also created Recoloration Proclamation featuring the installation, The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag (2004).From his catalog essay from the Rhythm of Structure: Mathematics, Art and Poetic exhibition, Sims sets the curatorial theme where he writes: "Mathematics, as a parameter of human consciousness in an indispensable conceptual technology, essential is seeing beyond the retinal and knowing beyond the intuitive. The language and process of mathematics, as elements of, foundation for art, inform an analytic expressive condition that inspires a visual reckoning for a convergence: from the illustrative to the metaphysical to the poetic. And in the dialectic of visual art call and text performative response, there is an inter-dimensional conversation where the twisting structures of language, vision and human ways give birth to the spiritual lattice of a social geometry, a community constructivism -- a place of connections, where emotional calculations meet spirited abstraction."First premiering at the Fire Patrol No.5 Gallery in 2003, with the show Rhythm of Structure: MathArt in Harlem. This interdisciplinary project has featured numerous exhibitions around the country collaborating with many notable artists, writers, and musicians including: Sol LeWitt, Adrian Piper, Dorothea Rockburne, Al Loving, Joe Overstreet, Howardena Pindell, Helaman Ferguson, John Hiigli, Vandorn Hinnant, Karen Finley, Dread Scott, Paul D. Miller, Bob Holman, Kate Rushin, Roman Verostko, Joan Waltemath, Tara Betts, Brent Collins, Mike Field, Kazmier Maslanka, Ken Hiratsuka, Yael Acher Moriano, Richard Kostelanetz, Kristin Prevallet, John Sims, and former U.S. Poet Laureate Mark Strand.In addition to the exhibitions, another major aim of Rhythm of Structure is the building of an interdisciplinary creative community around the intersection of mathematics and all forms of art, as it might inspire new art, innovation art and mathematics education, and increased respect and understanding of the rhythm and structure of nature itself. Such community experiences are created through call and response performances, social media and special video music projects such as The Rhythm of Structure and The Pi Day Anthem featuring John Sims and Vi Hart .

Background
Rhythm of Structure has its beginnings in Simsâ€™ work as one of the international curators for the exhibition Science in the Arts - Art in the Sciences, a citywide exhibition, in conjunction with the UNESCO-ICSU World Conference of Science, Budapest, Hungary in 1999.This led to the exhibition, MathArt/ArtMath, curated by John Sims (then Coordinator of Mathematics at Ringling) and Kevin Dean, at the Selby Gallery Ringling College of Art and Design in 2002. This show presented a general survey of art inspired and framed by mathematics ideas of mostly American modern and contemporary artists, as well as mathematicians working in the area of visual mathematics. The theme of the show was designed to examine the complexity and diversity of the meaning of mathematical art. The MathArt/ArtMath exhibition featured: Josef Albers, Thomas Banchoff, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Manuelo Baez, Jhane Barnes, Max Bill, Mel Bochner, Brent Collins, David Davis, George Deem, Agnes Denes, M.C. Escher, Fred Eversley, Shannon Fagan, Helaman Ferguson, Mike Field, Charles Gaines, Paulus Gerdes, Bathsheba Grossman, Al Held, John Hiigli, Slavik Jablan, Alfred Jensen, Andrienne Klein, Sol LeWitt, Arthur Lee Loeb, Paul D. Miller aka DJ Spooky, Marlena Novak, Joe Overstreet, Howardena Pindell, Richard Purdy, Tony Robbin, Dorothea Rockburne, Frank Rothkamm, Irene Rousseau, Carlo Sequin, John Sims, John Sullivan, Jack Tworkov, Roman Verostko, and John Waltemath.  There was a brochure and video produced for this exhibition.After the MathArt/ArtMath exhibition, Sims began working on a text about the nature of mathematical art leading to his chapter, Trees, Roots and a Brain: A Metaphorical Foundation for Mathematical Art, in the book Mathematics and Culture II: Visual Perfection: Mathematics and Creativity. In his chapter, he presents his ideas on the interconnection of mathematics, art and nature, setting the stage for his next group of exhibitions called Rhythm of Structure.

Publications
Rhythm of Structure Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection: Bowery and Beyond - Exhibition Catalogue 
In 2011, the catalog Rhythm of Structure Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection: Bowery and Beyond was produced by Selby Gallery and Antioch College Herndon Gallery at Ringling College of Art and Design and John Sims, containing all 9 of the Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection exhibits. Sarasota Herald Tribune previewed and reviewed the exhibition catalog at Selby Gallery, and the film at the Sarasota Film Festival.Rhythm of Structure: MathArt in the African Diaspora - International Review of African American Art

NYU course
In the spring of 2010, in connection to the Rhythm of Structure: Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection at the Bowery Poetry Club, John Sims was invited to teach a course for the department of Art and Public Policy at Tisch School of the Arts. The course, "Rhythm of Structure: Trees, Flags and Clock", examined the mechanisms/structures of developing John Sims' three large-scale interdisciplinary art projects (as case studies), which explored issues of social justice, community building, and the politics of grand scale works. With these multi-level projects-in-progress, which intersect the space of art with mathematics, visual politics, and social networking,  the course investigated the various strategies and challenges in creating a system of objects-texts-sounds-works that employs the tools of social organizing, media, technology, culture jamming, performance, poetry, and satire.The student final group project was a collective video-poetry response to the Sol LeWitt and Adrian Piper exhibition, Selected Infinite Extensions Arbitrarily Constrained, which was up at that point at the Rhythm of Structure exhibition at the Bowery Poetry Club. The video and live student readings were also presented at the closing of the show.

Film
Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection was made into a documentary, Rhythm of Structure: Bowery and Beyond, and presented at Sarasota Film Festival in 2012. The film was also previewed and reviewed by the Saratosa Herald Tribune.In connection to the film screening, there was are dinner, art performance reception featuring John Sims and Karen Finley's Square of Love installation from the Rhythm of Structure exhibition at the Bowery Poetry Club. The dinner featured a special menu prepared by Chef Gene Marra inspired by roots and love.  The performance program included Twinkle, the late Kenny Drew Jr., Thomas Carabasi,  Eleonora Lvov, Nate Jacobs, Michael Mendez, Kyleelise Holmes, Greg Tate and Bahiyyah Maroon.
