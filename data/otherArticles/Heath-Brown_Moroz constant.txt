The Heath-Brown–Moroz constant C, named for Roger Heath-Brown and Boris Moroz, is defined as

  
    
      
        C
        =
        
          ∏

              −
              
                
                  1
                  p
                
              
            
            )

    {\displaystyle C=\prod _{p}\left(1-{\frac {1}{p}}\right)^{7}\left(1+{\frac {7p+1}{p^{2}}}\right)=0.001317641...}
  where p runs over the primes.

Application
This constant is part of an asymptotic estimate for the distribution of rational points of bounded height on the cubic surface X03=X1X2X3.  Let H be a positive real number and N(H) the number of solutions to the equation X03=X1X2X3 with all the Xi non-negative integers less than or equal to H and their greatest common divisor equal to 1.  Then

  
    
      
        N
        (
        H
        )
        =
        C
        ⋅
        
          
            
              H
              (
              log
              ⁡
              H
              
                )
                
                  6
                
              
            
            
              4
              ×
              6
              !
            
          
        
        +
        O
        (
        H
        (
        log
        ⁡
        H
        
          )
          
            5
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle N(H)=C\cdot {\frac {H(\log H)^{6}}{4\times 6!}}+O(H(\log H)^{5}).}
