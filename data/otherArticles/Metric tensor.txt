In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a metric tensor (or simply metric) is an additional structure on a manifold M (such as a surface) that allows defining distances and angles, just as the inner product on a Euclidean space allows defining distances and angles there.  More precisely, a metric tensor at a point p of M is a bilinear form defined on the tangent space at p (that is, a bilinear function that maps pairs of tangent vectors to real numbers), and a metric tensor on M consists of a metric tensor at each point p of M that varies smoothly with p.
A metric tensor g is positive-definite if g(v, v) > 0 for every nonzero vector v.  A manifold equipped with a positive-definite metric tensor is known as a Riemannian manifold.  Such a metric tensor can be thought of as specifying infinitesimal distance on the manifold.  On a Riemannian manifold M, the length of a smooth curve between two points p and q can be defined by integration, and the distance between p and q can be defined as the infimum of the lengths of all such curves; this makes M a metric space.  Conversely, the metric tensor itself is the derivative of the distance function (taken in a suitable manner).While the notion of a metric tensor was known in some sense to mathematicians such as Gauss from the early 19th century, it was not until the early 20th century that its properties as a tensor were understood by, in particular, Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita, who first codified the notion of a tensor.  The metric tensor is an example of a tensor field.
The components of a metric tensor in a coordinate basis take on the form of a symmetric matrix whose entries transform covariantly under changes to the coordinate system.  Thus a metric tensor is a covariant symmetric tensor.  From the coordinate-independent point of view, a metric tensor field is defined to be a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on each tangent space that varies smoothly from point to point.

Introduction
Carl Friedrich Gauss in his 1827 Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas (General investigations of curved surfaces) considered a surface parametrically, with the Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z of points on the surface depending on two auxiliary variables u and v. Thus a parametric surface is (in today's terms) a vector-valued function

  depending on an ordered pair of real variables (u, v), and defined in an open set D in the uv-plane. One of the chief aims of Gauss's investigations was to deduce those features of the surface which could be described by a function which would remain unchanged if the surface underwent a transformation in space (such as bending the surface without stretching it), or a change in the particular parametric form of the same geometrical surface.
One natural such invariant quantity is the length of a curve drawn along the surface. Another is the angle between a pair of curves drawn along the surface and meeting at a common point. A third such quantity is the area of a piece of the surface. The study of these invariants of a surface led Gauss to introduce the predecessor of the modern notion of the metric tensor.

Arc length
If the variables u and v are taken to depend on a third variable, t, taking values in an interval [a, b], then r→(u(t), v(t)) will trace out a parametric curve in parametric surface M. The arc length of that curve is given by the integral

The quantity ds in (1) is called the line element, while ds2 is called the first fundamental form of M. Intuitively, it represents the principal part of the square of the displacement undergone by r→(u, v) when u is increased by du units, and v is increased by dv units.
Using matrix notation, the first fundamental form becomes

Coordinate transformations
Suppose now that a different parameterization is selected, by allowing u and v to depend on another pair of variables u′ and v′. Then the analog of (2) for the new variables is

The chain rule relates E′, F′, and G′ to E, F, and G via the matrix equation

where the superscript T denotes the matrix transpose. The matrix with the coefficients E, F, and G arranged in this way therefore transforms by the Jacobian matrix of the coordinate change

Invariance of arclength under coordinate transformations
Ricci-Curbastro & Levi-Civita (1900) first observed the significance of a system of coefficients E, F, and G, that transformed in this way on passing from one system of coordinates to another. The upshot is that the first fundamental form (1) is invariant under changes in the coordinate system, and that this follows exclusively from the transformation properties of E, F, and G. Indeed, by the chain rule,

Length and angle
Another interpretation of the metric tensor, also considered by Gauss, is that it provides a way in which to compute the length of tangent vectors to the surface, as well as the angle between two tangent vectors. In contemporary terms, the metric tensor allows one to compute the dot product(non-euclidean geometry) of tangent vectors in a manner independent of the parametric description of the surface. Any tangent vector at a point of the parametric surface M can be written in the form

  This is plainly a function of the four variables a1, b1, a2, and b2. It is more profitably viewed, however, as a function that takes a pair of arguments a = [a1 a2] and b = [b1 b2] which are vectors in the uv-plane. That is, put

  This is a symmetric function in a and b, meaning that

  
    
      
        g
        (

    {\displaystyle g(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )=g(\mathbf {b} ,\mathbf {a} )\,.}
  It is also bilinear, meaning that it is linear in each variable a and b separately. That is,

Area
The surface area is another numerical quantity which should depend only on the surface itself, and not on how it is parameterized. If the surface M is parameterized by the function r→(u, v) over the domain D in the uv-plane, then the surface area of M is given by the integral

Definition
Let M be a smooth manifold of dimension n; for instance a surface (in the case n = 2) or hypersurface in the Cartesian space

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}}
  . At each point p ∈ M there is a vector space TpM, called the tangent space, consisting of all tangent vectors to the manifold at the point p. A metric tensor at p is a function gp(Xp, Yp) which takes as inputs a pair of tangent vectors Xp and Yp at p, and produces as an output a real number (scalar), so that the following conditions are satisfied:

gp is bilinear. A function of two vector arguments is bilinear if it is linear separately in each argument. Thus if Up, Vp, Yp are three tangent vectors at p and a and b are real numbers, then 
gp is symmetric. A function of two vector arguments is symmetric provided that for all vectors Xp and Yp, 
gp is nondegenerate. A bilinear function is nondegenerate provided that, for every tangent vector Xp ≠ 0, the function  obtained by holding Xp constant and allowing Yp to vary is not identically zero. That is, for every Xp ≠ 0 there exists a Yp such that gp(Xp, Yp) ≠ 0.A metric tensor field g on M assigns to each point p of M a metric tensor gp in the tangent space at p in a way that varies smoothly with p. More precisely, given any open subset U of manifold M and any (smooth) vector fields X and Y on U, the real function

is a smooth function of p.

Components of the metric

Signature of a metric

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle q_{m}(X_{m})=g_{m}(X_{m},X_{m})\,,\quad X_{m}\in T_{m}M.}
  If qm is positive for all non-zero Xm, then the metric is positive-definite at m. If the metric is positive-definite at every m ∈ M, then g is called a Riemannian metric. More generally, if the quadratic forms qm have constant signature independent of m, then the signature of g is this signature, and g is called a pseudo-Riemannian metric. If M is connected, then the signature of qm does not depend on m.By Sylvester's law of inertia, a basis of tangent vectors Xi can be chosen locally so that the quadratic form diagonalizes in the following manner

  for some p between 1 and n. Any two such expressions of q (at the same point m of M) will have the same number p of positive signs. The signature of g is the pair of integers (p, n − p), signifying that there are p positive signs and n − p negative signs in any such expression. Equivalently, the metric has signature (p, n − p) if the matrix gij of the metric has p positive and n − p negative eigenvalues.
Certain metric signatures which arise frequently in applications are:

If g has signature (n, 0), then g is a Riemannian metric, and M is called a Riemannian manifold. Otherwise, g is a pseudo-Riemannian metric, and M is called a pseudo-Riemannian manifold (the term semi-Riemannian is also used).
If M is four-dimensional with signature (1, 3) or (3, 1), then the metric is called Lorentzian. More generally, a metric tensor in dimension n other than 4 of signature (1, n − 1) or (n − 1, 1) is sometimes also called Lorentzian.
If M is 2n-dimensional and g has signature (n, n), then the metric is called ultrahyperbolic.

Inverse metric
Let f = (X1, ..., Xn) be a basis of vector fields, and as above let G[f] be the matrix of coefficients

  
    
      
        
          g
          
            i
            j
          
        
        [
        
          f
        
        ]
        =
        g
        
          (
          
            
              X
              
                i
              
            
            ,
            
              X
              
                j
              
            
          
          )
        
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{ij}[\mathbf {f} ]=g\left(X_{i},X_{j}\right)\,.}
  One can consider the inverse matrix G[f]−1, which is identified with the inverse metric (or conjugate or dual metric). The inverse metric satisfies a transformation law when the frame f is changed by a matrix A via

The inverse metric transforms contravariantly, or with respect to the inverse of the change of basis matrix A. Whereas the metric itself provides a way to measure the length of (or angle between) vector fields, the inverse metric supplies a means of measuring the length of (or angle between) covector fields; that is, fields of linear functionals.
To see this, suppose that α is a covector field. To wit, for each point p, α determines a function αp defined on tangent vectors at p so that the following linearity condition holds for all tangent vectors Xp and Yp, and all real numbers a and b:

  
    
      
        
          α
          
            p
          
        
        
          (
          
            a
            
              X
              
                p
              
            
            +
            b
            
              Y
              
                p
              
            
          
          )
        
        =
        a
        
          α
          
            p
          
        
        
          (
          
            X
            
              p
            
          
          )
        
        +
        b
        
          α
          
            p
          
        
        
          (
          
            Y
            
              p
            
          
          )
        
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha _{p}\left(aX_{p}+bY_{p}\right)=a\alpha _{p}\left(X_{p}\right)+b\alpha _{p}\left(Y_{p}\right)\,.}
  As p varies, α is assumed to be a smooth function in the sense that

  
    
      
        p
        ↦
        
          α
          
            p
          
        
        
          (
          
            X
            
              p
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\mapsto \alpha _{p}\left(X_{p}\right)}
  is a smooth function of p for any smooth vector field X.
Any covector field α has components in the basis of vector fields f. These are determined by

  
    
      
        
          α
          
            i
          
        
        =
        α
        
          (
          
            X
            
              i
            
          
          )
        
        
        ,
        
        i
        =
        1

        2
        ,
        …

        n
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}=\alpha \left(X_{i}\right)\,,\quad i=1,2,\dots ,n\,.}
  Denote the row vector of these components by

  So that the right-hand side of equation (6) is unaffected by changing the basis f to any other basis fA whatsoever. Consequently, the equation may be assigned a meaning independently of the choice of basis. The entries of the matrix G[f] are denoted by gij, where the indices i and j have been raised to indicate the transformation law (5).

Raising and lowering indices
In a basis of vector fields f = (X1, ..., Xn), any smooth tangent vector field X can be written in the form

for some uniquely determined smooth functions v1, ..., vn. Upon changing the basis f by a nonsingular matrix A, the coefficients vi change in such a way that equation (7) remains true. That is,

  
    
      
        X
        =
        
          f
          A
        
        v
        [
        
          f
          A
        
        ]
        =
        
          f
        
        v
        [
        
          f
        
        ]
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X=\mathbf {fA} v[\mathbf {fA} ]=\mathbf {f} v[\mathbf {f} ]\,.}
  Consequently, v[fA] = A−1v[f]. In other words, the components of a vector transform contravariantly (that is, inversely or in the opposite way) under a change of basis by the nonsingular matrix A. The contravariance of the components of v[f] is notationally designated by placing the indices of vi[f] in the upper position.
A frame also allows covectors to be expressed in terms of their components. For the basis of vector fields f = (X1, ..., Xn) define the dual basis to be the linear functionals (θ1[f], ..., θn[f]) such that

        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha =a[\mathbf {f} A]\theta [\mathbf {f} A]=a[\mathbf {f} ]\theta [\mathbf {f} ]}
  whence, because θ[fA] = A−1θ[f], it follows that a[fA] = a[f]A. That is, the components a transform covariantly (by the matrix A rather than its inverse). The covariance of the components of a[f] is notationally designated by placing the indices of ai[f] in the lower position.
Now, the metric tensor gives a means to identify vectors and covectors as follows. Holding Xp fixed, the function

  
    
      
        
          g
          
            p
          
        
        (
        
          X
          
            p
          
        
        ,
        −
        )
        :
        
          Y
          
            p
          
        
        ↦
        
          g
          
            p
          
        
        (
        
          X
          
            p
          
        
        ,
        
          Y

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{p}(X_{p},-):Y_{p}\mapsto g_{p}(X_{p},Y_{p})}
  of tangent vector Yp defines a linear functional on the tangent space at p. This operation takes a vector Xp at a point p and produces a covector gp(Xp, −). In a basis of vector fields f, if a vector field X has components v[f], then the components of the covector field g(X, −) in the dual basis are given by the entries of the row vector

  
    
      
        a

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle a[\mathbf {f} ]=v[\mathbf {f} ]^{\mathsf {T}}G[\mathbf {f} ].}
  Under a change of basis f ↦ fA, the right-hand side of this equation transforms via

  so that a[fA] = a[f]A: a transforms covariantly. The operation of associating to the (contravariant) components of a vector field v[f] = [ v1[f] v2[f] ... vn[f] ]T the (covariant) components of the covector field a[f] = [ a1[f] a2[f] … an[f] ], where

    {\displaystyle a_{i}[\mathbf {f} ]=\sum _{k=1}^{n}v^{k}[\mathbf {f} ]g_{ki}[\mathbf {f} ]}
  is called lowering the index.
To raise the index, one applies the same construction but with the inverse metric instead of the metric. If a[f] = [ a1[f] a2[f] ... an[f] ] are the components of a covector in the dual basis θ[f], then the column vector

has components which transform contravariantly:

  
    
      
        v
        [
        
          f
        
        A
        ]
        =
        
          A
          
            −
            1
          
        
        v
        [
        
          f
        
        ]
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle v[\mathbf {f} A]=A^{-1}v[\mathbf {f} ].}
  Consequently, the quantity X = fv[f] does not depend on the choice of basis f in an essential way, and thus defines a vector field on M. The operation (9) associating to the (covariant) components of a covector a[f] the (contravariant) components of a vector v[f] given is called raising the index. In components, (9) is

Induced metric
Let U be an open set in ℝn, and let φ be a continuously differentiable function from U into the Euclidean space ℝm, where m > n. The mapping φ is called an immersion if its differential is injective at every point of U. The image of φ is called an immersed submanifold. More specifically, for m = 3, which means that the ambient Euclidean space is ℝ3, the induced metric tensor is called the first fundamental form.
Suppose that φ is an immersion onto the submanifold M ⊂ Rm. The usual Euclidean dot product in ℝm is a metric which, when restricted to vectors tangent to M, gives a means for taking the dot product of these tangent vectors. This is called the induced metric.
Suppose that v is a tangent vector at a point of U, say

  
    
      
        v
        =
        
          v
          
            1

  where ei are the standard coordinate vectors in ℝn. When φ is applied to U, the vector v goes over to the vector tangent to M given by

  (This is called the pushforward of v along φ.) Given two such vectors, v and w, the induced metric is defined by

  
    
      
        g

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(v,w)=\varphi _{*}(v)\cdot \varphi _{*}(w).}
  It follows from a straightforward calculation that the matrix of the induced metric in the basis of coordinate vector fields e is given by

  
    
      
        G

Intrinsic definitions of a metric
The notion of a metric can be defined intrinsically using the language of fiber bundles and vector bundles. In these terms, a metric tensor is a function

from the fiber product of the tangent bundle of M with itself to R such that the restriction of g to each fiber is a nondegenerate bilinear mapping

  
    
      
        
          g
          
            p
          
        
        :
        
          
            T
          
          
            p
          
        
        M
        ×
        
          
            T
          
          
            p
          
        
        M
        →
        
          R
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{p}:\mathrm {T} _{p}M\times \mathrm {T} _{p}M\to \mathbf {R} .}
  The mapping (10) is required to be continuous, and often continuously differentiable, smooth, or real analytic, depending on the case of interest, and whether M can support such a structure.

Metric as a section of a bundle
By the universal property of the tensor product, any bilinear mapping (10) gives rise naturally to a section g⊗ of the dual of the tensor product bundle of TM with itself

  
    
      
        
          g
          
            ⊗
          
        
        ∈
        Γ
        
          (
          
            (
            
              T
            
            M
            ⊗
            
              T
            
            M
            
              )
              
                ∗
              
            
          
          )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{\otimes }\in \Gamma \left((\mathrm {T} M\otimes \mathrm {T} M)^{*}\right).}
  The section g⊗ is defined on simple elements of TM ⊗ TM by

  
    
      
        
          g
          
            ⊗
          
        
        (
        v
        ⊗
        w
        )
        =
        g
        (
        v
        ,
        w
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{\otimes }(v\otimes w)=g(v,w)}
  and is defined on arbitrary elements of TM ⊗ TM by extending linearly to linear combinations of simple elements. The original bilinear form g is symmetric if and only if

  
    
      
        
          g
          
            ⊗
          
        
        ∘
        τ
        =
        
          g
          
            ⊗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{\otimes }\circ \tau =g_{\otimes }}
  where

  
    
      
        τ
        :
        
          T
        
        M
        ⊗
        
          T
        
        M
        
          
            
              
                →
              
              
                ≅
              
            
          
        
        T
        M
        ⊗
        T
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau :\mathrm {T} M\otimes \mathrm {T} M{\stackrel {\cong }{\to }}TM\otimes TM}
  is the braiding map.
Since M is finite-dimensional, there is a natural isomorphism

  
    
      
        (
        
          T
        
        M
        ⊗
        
          T
        
        M
        
          )
          
            ∗
          
        
        ≅
        
          
            T
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        M
        ⊗
        
          
            T
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        M
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\mathrm {T} M\otimes \mathrm {T} M)^{*}\cong \mathrm {T} ^{*}M\otimes \mathrm {T} ^{*}M,}
  so that g⊗ is regarded also as a section of the bundle T*M ⊗ T*M of the cotangent bundle T*M with itself. Since g is symmetric as a bilinear mapping, it follows that g⊗ is a symmetric tensor.

Metric in a vector bundle
More generally, one may speak of a metric in a vector bundle. If E is a vector bundle over a manifold M, then a metric is a mapping

  
    
      
        g
        :
        E
        
          ×
          
            M
          
        
        E
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g:E\times _{M}E\to \mathbf {R} }
  from the fiber product of E to R which is bilinear in each fiber:

  
    
      
        
          g
          
            p
          
        
        :
        
          E
          
            p
          
        
        ×
        
          E
          
            p
          
        
        →
        
          R
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{p}:E_{p}\times E_{p}\to \mathbf {R} .}
  Using duality as above, a metric is often identified with a section of the tensor product bundle E* ⊗ E*. (See metric (vector bundle).)

Tangent–cotangent isomorphism
The metric tensor gives a natural isomorphism from the tangent bundle to the cotangent bundle, sometimes called the musical isomorphism. This isomorphism is obtained by setting, for each tangent vector Xp ∈ TpM,

  
    
      
        
          S
          
            g
          
        
        
          X
          
            p
          
        
        
        
          
            
              
                =
              
              
                def
              
            
          
        
        
        g
        (
        
          X
          
            p
          
        
        ,
        −
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle S_{g}X_{p}\,{\stackrel {\text{def}}{=}}\,g(X_{p},-),}
  the linear functional on TpM which sends a tangent vector Yp at p to gp(Xp,Yp). That is, in terms of the pairing [−, −] between TpM and its dual space T∗pM,

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{S}(X_{p},Y_{p})=[SX_{p},Y_{p}]\,.}
  This bilinear form is symmetric if and only if S is symmetric. There is thus a natural one-to-one correspondence between symmetric bilinear forms on TpM and symmetric linear isomorphisms of TpM to the dual T∗pM.
As p varies over M, Sg defines a section of the bundle Hom(TM, T*M) of vector bundle isomorphisms of the tangent bundle to the cotangent bundle. This section has the same smoothness as g: it is continuous, differentiable, smooth, or real-analytic according as g. The mapping Sg, which associates to every vector field on M a covector field on M gives an abstract formulation of "lowering the index" on a vector field. The inverse of Sg is a mapping T*M → TM which, analogously, gives an abstract formulation of "raising the index" on a covector field.

Arclength and the line element
Suppose that g is a Riemannian metric on M. In a local coordinate system xi, i = 1, 2, …, n, the metric tensor appears as a matrix, denoted here by G, whose entries are the components gij of the metric tensor relative to the coordinate vector fields.
Let γ(t) be a piecewise-differentiable parametric curve in M, for a ≤ t ≤ b. The arclength of the curve is defined by

  This usage comes from physics, specifically, classical mechanics, where the integral E can be seen to directly correspond to the kinetic energy of a point particle moving on the surface of a manifold. Thus, for example, in Jacobi's formulation of Maupertuis' principle, the metric tensor can be seen to correspond to the mass tensor of a moving particle.
In many cases, whenever a calculation calls for the length to be used, a similar calculation using the energy may be done as well. This often leads to simpler formulas by avoiding the need for the square-root. Thus, for example, the geodesic equations may be obtained by applying variational principles to either the length or the energy. In the latter case, the geodesic equations are seen to arise from the principle of least action: they describe the motion of a "free particle" (a particle feeling no forces) that is confined to move on the manifold, but otherwise moves freely, with constant momentum, within the manifold.

Canonical measure and volume form
In analogy with the case of surfaces, a metric tensor on an n-dimensional paracompact manifold M gives rise to a natural way to measure the n-dimensional volume of subsets of the manifold. The resulting natural positive Borel measure allows one to develop a theory of integrating functions on the manifold by means of the associated Lebesgue integral.
A measure can be defined, by the Riesz representation theorem, by giving a positive linear functional Λ on the space C0(M) of compactly supported continuous functions on M. More precisely, if M is a manifold with a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric tensor g, then there is a unique positive Borel measure μg such that for any coordinate chart (U, φ),

for all f supported in U. Here det g is the determinant of the matrix formed by the components of the metric tensor in the coordinate chart. That Λ is well-defined on functions supported in coordinate neighborhoods is justified by Jacobian change of variables. It extends to a unique positive linear functional on C0(M) by means of a partition of unity.
If M is also oriented, then it is possible to define a natural volume form from the metric tensor. In a positively oriented coordinate system (x1, ..., xn) the volume form is represented as

where the dxi are the coordinate differentials and ∧ denotes the exterior product in the algebra of differential forms. The volume form also gives a way to integrate functions on the manifold, and this geometric integral agrees with the integral obtained by the canonical Borel measure.

Examples
Euclidean metric
The most familiar example is that of elementary Euclidean geometry: the two-dimensional Euclidean metric tensor. In the usual Cartesian (x, y) coordinates, we can write

  
    
      
        g
        =
        
          
            [
            
              
                
                  1
                
                
                  0
                
              
              
                
                  0
                
                
                  1
                
              
            
            ]
          
        
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g={\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}}\,.}
  The length of a curve reduces to the formula:

  
    
      
        L
        =
        
          ∫
          
            a
          
          
            b
          
        
        
          
            (
            d
            x
            
              )
              
                2
              
            
            +
            (
            d
            y
            
              )
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle L=\int _{a}^{b}{\sqrt {(dx)^{2}+(dy)^{2}}}\,.}

The round metric on a sphere
The unit sphere in ℝ3 comes equipped with a natural metric induced from the ambient Euclidean metric, through the process explained in the induced metric section. In standard spherical coordinates (θ, φ), with θ the colatitude, the angle measured from the z-axis, and φ the angle from the x-axis in the xy-plane, the metric takes the form
