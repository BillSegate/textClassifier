Sphuṭacandrāpti (Computation of True Moon) is a treatise in Sanskrit composed by the fourteenth-century CE Kerala astronomer-mathematician Sangamagrama Madhava. The treatise enunciates a method for the computation of the position of the moon at intervals of 40 minutes each throughout the day. This is one of only two works of Madhava that have survived to modern times, the other one being Veṇvāroha. However, both Sphuṭacandrāpti and Veṇvāroha have more or less the same contents, that of the latter being apparently a more refined version of that of the former.

Critical editions
