The MRB constant is a mathematical constant, with decimal expansion 0.187859… (sequence A037077 in the OEIS). The constant is named after its discoverer, Marvin Ray Burns, who published his discovery of the constant in 1999. Burns had initially called the constant "rc" for root constant but, at Simon Plouffe's suggestion, the constant was renamed the 'Marvin Ray Burns's Constant', or "MRB constant".The MRB constant is defined as the upper limit of the partial sums

  The constant relates to the divergent series:

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            k

            k
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{\infty }(-1)^{k}k^{1/k}.}
  There is no known closed-form expression of the MRB constant, nor is it known whether the MRB constant is algebraic, transcendental or even irrational.
