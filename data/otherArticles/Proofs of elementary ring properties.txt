The following proofs of elementary ring properties use only the axioms that define a mathematical ring:

Basics
Multiplication by zero
Theorem: 
  
    
      
        0
        ⋅
        a
        =
        a
        ⋅
        0
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\cdot a=a\cdot 0=0}

Unique identity element per binary operation
Theorem: The identity element e for a binary operation (addition or multiplication) of a ring is unique.

Unique additive inverse element
Theorem: - a as the additive inverse element for a is unique.

Unique multiplicative inverse element
Theorem: a−1 as the multiplicative inverse element for a is unique.

Zero ring
Theorem: A ring 
  
    
      
        (
        R
        ,
        +
        ,
        ⋅
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (R,+,\cdot )}
   is the zero ring (that is, consists of precisely one element) if and only if 
  
    
      
        0
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0=1}
  .

Multiplication by negative one
Theorem: 
  
    
      
        (
        −
        1
        )
        a
        =
        −
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle (-1)a=-a}

Multiplication by additive inverse
Theorem: 
  
    
      
        (
        −
        a
        )
        ⋅
        b
        =
        a
        ⋅
        (
        −
        b
        )
        =
        −
        (
        a
        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (-a)\cdot b=a\cdot (-b)=-(ab)}
