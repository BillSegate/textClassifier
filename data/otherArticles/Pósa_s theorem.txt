Pósa's theorem, in graph theory, is a sufficient condition for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle based on the degrees of the vertices in an undirected graph. It implies two other degree-based sufficient conditions, Dirac's theorem on Hamiltonian cycles and Ore's theorem. Unlike those conditions, it can be applied to graphs with a small number of low-degree vertices. It is named after Lajos Pósa, a protégé of Paul Erdős born in 1947, who discovered this theorem in 1962.

   having

   vertices requires that, if the degrees of the

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle d_{1}\leq d_{2}\leq ...\leq d_{n},}
  then for each index

    {\displaystyle k<n/2}
   the inequality 
  
    
      
        k
        <
        
          d
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle k<d_{k}}
   is satisfied.
Pósa's theorem states that if a finite undirected graph satisfies the Pósa condition, then that graph has a Hamiltonian cycle in it.
