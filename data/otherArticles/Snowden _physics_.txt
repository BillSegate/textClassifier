A Snowden is a unit of soft X-ray emissivity, equivalent to 
  
    
      
        
          10
          
            −
            6
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 10^{-6}}
   ROSAT counts

            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{-1}arcmin^{-2}}
  . These units were chosen by S. L. Snowden when working with the ROSAT mission to create the ROSAT All-Sky Survey in order to make the surface brightness values fit into a two byte integer.
