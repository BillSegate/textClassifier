The resistive skin time is a characteristic time of typical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena.

Definition
The resistive skin time is defined as:

  
    
      
        
          τ
          
            R
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                μ
                
                  0
                
              
              
                a
                
                  2
                
              
            
            η
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau _{R}={\frac {\mu _{0}a^{2}}{\eta }}}
  
where 
  
    
      
        η
      
    
    {\displaystyle \eta }
   is the resistivity, 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is a typical radius of the device and 
  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu _{0}}
   is the magnetic permeability.
