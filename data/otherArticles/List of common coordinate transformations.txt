This is a list of some of the most commonly used coordinate transformations.

2-dimensional
Let 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,y)}
   be the standard Cartesian coordinates, and 
  
    
      
        (
        r
        ,
        θ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (r,\theta )}
   the standard polar coordinates.

By using complex numbers 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        x
        +
        i
        
          y
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,y)=x+iy'}
  , the transformation can be written as

That is, it is given by the complex exponential function.

          θ
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta '}
   returns the resultant angle in the first quadrant (
  
    
      
        0
        <
        θ
        <
        
          
            π

    {\textstyle 0<\theta <{\frac {\pi }{2}}}
  ). To find 
  
    
      
        θ
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta ,}
   one must refer to the original Cartesian coordinate, determine the quadrant in which 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   lies (for example, (3,−3) [Cartesian] lies in QIV), then use the following to solve for 
  
    
      
        θ
        :
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta :}
  

The value for 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   must be solved for in this manner because for all values of 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  , 
  
    
      
        tan
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tan \theta }
   is only defined for 
  
    
      
        −
        
          
            π
            2
          
        
        <
        θ
        <
        +
        
          
            π
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle -{\frac {\pi }{2}}<\theta <+{\frac {\pi }{2}}}
  , and is periodic (with period 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
  ). This means that the inverse function will only give values in the domain of the function, but restricted to a single period. Hence, the range of the inverse function is only half a full circle.

3-dimensional
Let (x, y, z) be the standard Cartesian coordinates, and (ρ, θ, φ) the spherical coordinates, with θ the angle measured away from the +Z axis (as [1], see conventions in spherical coordinates). As φ has a range of 360° the same considerations as in polar (2 dimensional) coordinates apply whenever an arctangent of it is taken. θ has a range of 180°, running from 0° to 180°, and does not pose any problem when calculated from an arccosine, but beware for an arctangent.
If, in the alternative definition, θ is chosen to run from −90° to +90°, in opposite direction of the earlier definition, it can be found uniquely from an arcsine, but beware of an arccotangent. In this case in all formulas below all arguments in θ should have sine and cosine exchanged, and as derivative also a plus and minus exchanged.
All divisions by zero result in special cases of being directions along one of the main axes and are in practice most easily solved by observation.
