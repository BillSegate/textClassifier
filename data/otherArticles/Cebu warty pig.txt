The Cebu warty pig (Sus cebifrons cebifrons) previously lived in Cebu, Philippines, before becoming extinct in modern times, primarily due to habitat destruction. This pig was assessed to be extinct in 2000.
The main species, Sus cebifrons, the Visayan warty pig, still found in the Philippines, is itself facing extinction.
