In mathematics, the term "characteristic function" can refer to any of several distinct concepts:

The indicator function of a subset, that is the function
  
    
      
        
          
            1
          
          
            A
          
        
        :
        X
        →
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        }
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {1} _{A}\colon X\to \{0,1\},}
  
which for a given subset A of X, has value 1 at points of A and 0 at points of X − A.The characteristic function in convex analysis, closely related to the indicator function of a set:

  
    
      
        
          χ
          
            A
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        :=
        
          
            {
            
              
                
                  0
                  ,
                
                
                  x
                  ∈
                  A
                  ;
                
              
              
                
                  +
                  ∞
                  ,
                
                
                  x
                  ∉
                  A
                  .
                
              
            
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi _{A}(x):={\begin{cases}0,&x\in A;\\+\infty ,&x\not \in A.\end{cases}}}
  
In probability theory, the characteristic function of any probability distribution on the real line is given by the following formula, where X is any random variable with the distribution in question:

  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            X
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        E
        ⁡
        
          (
          
            e
            
              i
              t
              X
            
          
          )
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{X}(t)=\operatorname {E} \left(e^{itX}\right),}
  
where 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} }
   denotes expected value. For multivariate distributions, the product tX is replaced by a scalar product of vectors.
