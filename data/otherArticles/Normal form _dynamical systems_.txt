In mathematics, the normal form of a dynamical system is a simplified form that can be useful in determining the system's behavior.
Normal forms are often used for determining local bifurcations in a system. All systems exhibiting a certain type of bifurcation are locally (around the equilibrium) topologically equivalent to the normal form of the bifurcation. For example, the normal form of a saddle-node bifurcation is

              x

              t

    {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} x}{\mathrm {d} t}}=\mu +x^{2}}
  where 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   is the bifurcation parameter. The transcritical bifurcation
