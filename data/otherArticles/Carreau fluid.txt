The dynamics of fluid motions is an important area of physics, with many important and commercially significant applications.
Computers are often used to calculate the motions of fluids, especially when the applications are of a safety critical nature.

Carreau Fluid Shear Rates
At low shear rate (

        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}\ll 1/\lambda }
  ) a Carreau fluid behaves as a Newtonian fluid with viscosity
