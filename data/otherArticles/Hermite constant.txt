In mathematics, the Hermite constant, named after Charles Hermite, determines how long a shortest element of a lattice in Euclidean space can be.
The constant γn for integers n > 0 is defined as follows.  For a lattice L in Euclidean space Rn with unit covolume, i.e. vol(Rn/L) = 1, let λ1(L) denote the least length of a nonzero element of L.  Then √γn is the maximum of λ1(L) over all such lattices L.
The square root in the definition of the Hermite constant is a matter of historical convention.
Alternatively, the Hermite constant γn can be defined as the square of the maximal systole of a flat n-dimensional torus of unit volume.

Example
The Hermite constant is known in dimensions 1–8 and 24. 

For n = 2, one has γ2 = 2/√3.  This value is attained by the hexagonal lattice of the Eisenstein integers.

Estimates
It is known that

  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            n
          
        
        ≤
        
          
            (
            
              
                4
                3
              
            
            )
          
          
            
              
                n
                −
                1
              
              2
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma _{n}\leq \left({\frac {4}{3}}\right)^{\frac {n-1}{2}}.}
  A stronger estimate due to Hans Frederick Blichfeldt is

  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            n
          
        
        ≤
        
          (
          
            
              2
              π
            
          
          )
        
        Γ
        
          
            (
            
              2
              +
              
                
                  n
                  2
                
              
            
            )
          
          
            
              2
              n
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma _{n}\leq \left({\frac {2}{\pi }}\right)\Gamma \left(2+{\frac {n}{2}}\right)^{\frac {2}{n}},}
  where 
  
    
      
        Γ
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma (x)}
   is the gamma function.
