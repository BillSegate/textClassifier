Probability theory and statistics have some commonly used conventions, in addition to standard mathematical notation and mathematical symbols.

Probability theory
Random variables are usually written in upper case roman letters: 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\textstyle X}
  , 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\textstyle Y}
  , etc.
Particular realizations of a random variable are written in corresponding lower case letters. For example, 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}}
   could be a sample corresponding to the random variable                                                                                                                                                                                            
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\textstyle X}
  . A cumulative probability is formally written 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        X
        ≤
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(X\leq x)}
   to differentiate the random variable from its realization.
The probability is sometimes written 
  
    
      
        
          P
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} }
   to distinguish it from other functions and measure P so as to avoid having to define "P is a probability" and 
  
    
      
        
          P
        
        (
        X
        ∈
        A
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} (X\in A)}
   is short for 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        {
        ω
        ∈
        Ω
        :
        X
        (
        ω
        )
        ∈
        A
        }
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(\{\omega \in \Omega :X(\omega )\in A\})}
  , where 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
   is the event space and 
  
    
      
        X
        (
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle X(\omega )}
   is a random variable. 
  
    
      
        Pr
        (
        A
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Pr(A)}
   notation is used alternatively.

  
    
      
        
          P
        
        (
        A
        ∩
        B
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} (A\cap B)}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          P
        
        [
        B
        ∩
        A
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} [B\cap A]}
   indicates the probability that events A and B both occur. The joint probability distribution of random variables X and Y is denoted as 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        X
        ,
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(X,Y)}
  , while joint probability mass function or probability density function as 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x,y)}
   and joint cumulative distribution function as 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(x,y)}
  .

  
    
      
        
          P
        
        (
        A
        ∪
        B
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} (A\cup B)}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          P
        
        [
        B
        ∪
        A
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} [B\cup A]}
   indicates the probability of either event A or event B occurring ("or" in this case means one or the other or both).
σ-algebras are usually written with uppercase calligraphic (e.g. 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
   for the set of sets on which we define the probability P)
Probability density functions (pdfs) and probability mass functions are denoted by lowercase letters, e.g. 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)}
  , or 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            X
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{X}(x)}
  .
Cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) are denoted by uppercase letters, e.g. 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(x)}
  , or 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            X
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{X}(x)}
  .
Survival functions or complementary cumulative distribution functions are often denoted by placing an overbar over the symbol for the cumulative:
  
    
      
        
          
            F
            ¯
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        1
        −
        F
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overline {F}}(x)=1-F(x)}
  , or denoted as 
  
    
      
        S
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S(x)}
  ,
In particular, the pdf of the standard normal distribution is denoted by 
  
    
      
        φ
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\textstyle \varphi (z)}
  , and its cdf by 
  
    
      
        Φ
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\textstyle \Phi (z)}
  .

          E

        X
        ]

   : variance of X

  
    
      
        cov
        ⁡
        [

        ]

   : covariance of X and YX is independent of Y is often written 
  
    
      
        X
        ⊥
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\perp Y}
   or 
  
    
      
        X
        ⊥

          P
          (
          A
          ∣
          B
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle P(A\mid B)}
  , the conditional probability, is the probability of 
  
    
      
        
          A
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle A}
   given 
  
    
      
        
          B
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle B}
  , i.e., 
  
    
      
        
          A
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle A}

Statistics
Greek letters (e.g. θ, β) are commonly used to denote unknown parameters (population parameters).
A tilde (~) denotes "has the probability distribution of".
Placing a hat, or caret (also known as a circumflex),  over a true parameter denotes an estimator of it, e.g., 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              θ
              ^
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\widehat {\theta }}}
   is an estimator for 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  .

    {\textstyle x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}}
   is often denoted by placing an "overbar" over the symbol, e.g. 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x

The α-level upper critical value of a probability distribution is the value exceeded with probability 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\textstyle \alpha }
  , that is, the value

          x
          
            α
          
        
        )

  , where 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\textstyle F}

Linear algebra
Matrices are usually denoted by boldface capital letters, e.g. 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle {\mathbf {A}}}
  .
Column vectors are usually denoted by boldface lowercase letters, e.g. 
  
    
      
        
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle {\mathbf {x}}}
  .
The transpose operator is denoted by either a superscript T (e.g. 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              A
            
          
          
            
              T
            
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle {\mathbf {A}}^{\mathrm {T} }}
  ) or a prime symbol (e.g. 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              A
            
          
          ′
        
      
    
    {\textstyle {\mathbf {A}}'}
  ).
A row vector is written as the transpose of a column vector, e.g. 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
            
          
          
            
              T
            
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle {\mathbf {x}}^{\mathrm {T} }}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
            
          
          ′
        
      
    
    {\textstyle {\mathbf {x}}'}
  .
