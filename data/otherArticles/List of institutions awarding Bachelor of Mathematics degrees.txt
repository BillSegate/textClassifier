A Bachelor of Mathematics (abbreviated B.Math or BMath) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded for successfully completing a program of study in mathematics or related disciplines, such as applied mathematics, actuarial science, computational science, data analytics, financial mathematics, mathematical physics,    pure mathematics, operations research or statistics. The Bachelor of Mathematics caters to high-achieving students seeking to develop a comprehensive specialised knowledge in a field of mathematics or a high level of sophistication in the applications of mathematics.
In practice, this is essentially equivalent to a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree with a speciality in mathematics.  Relatively few institutions award Bachelor of Mathematics degrees, and the distinction between those that do and those that award B.Sc or B.A. degrees for mathematics is usually bureaucratic, rather than curriculum related.

Duration
A BMath program generally lasts three years with a fourth "honours" year in Australia and University of Waterloo (Canada). The BMath program at Carleton is also four years. BMath programs are increasingly taking about five years to complete because of co-op or internship placements.
