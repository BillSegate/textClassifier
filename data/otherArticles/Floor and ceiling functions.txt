In mathematics and computer science, the floor function is the function  that takes as input a real number x, and gives as output the greatest integer less than or equal to x, denoted ⌊x⌋ or floor(x).  Similarly, the ceiling function maps x to the least integer greater than or equal to x, denoted ⌈x⌉ or ceil(x).For example, for floor: ⌊2.4⌋ = 2, ⌊−2.4⌋ = −3, and for ceiling: ⌈2.4⌉ = 3, and ⌈−2.4⌉ = −2.  
Historically, the floor of x has been–and still is–called the integral part or integer part of x, often denoted [x] (as well as a variety of other notations). However, the same term, integer part, is also used for truncation towards zero, which differs from the floor function for negative numbers.
For n an integer, ⌊n⌋ = ⌈n⌉ = [n] = n.
Although floor(x+1)  and ceil(x) produce graphs that appear exactly alike, they are not the same when the value of x is an exact integer. For example, when x=2.0001; ⌊2.0001+1⌋ = ⌈2.0001⌉ = 3. However, if x=2, then ⌊2+1⌋ = 3, while  ⌈2⌉ = 2.

Notation
The integral part or integer part of a number (partie entière in the original) was first defined in 1798 by Adrien-Marie Legendre in his proof of the Legendre's formula.
Carl Friedrich Gauss introduced the square bracket notation [x] in his third proof of quadratic reciprocity (1808). This remained the standard in mathematics until Kenneth E. Iverson introduced, in his 1962 book A Programming Language, the names "floor" and "ceiling" and the corresponding notations ⌊x⌋ and ⌈x⌉. (Iverson used square brackets for a different purpose, the Iverson bracket notation.) Both notations are now used in mathematics, although Iverson's notation will be followed in this article.
In some sources, boldface or double brackets ⟦x⟧ are used for floor, and reversed brackets ⟧x⟦ or ]x[ for ceiling.The fractional part is the sawtooth function, denoted by {x}  for real x and defined by the formula

{x} = x − ⌊x⌋For all x,

0 ≤ {x} < 1.These characters are provided in Unicode:

U+2309 ⌉ RIGHT CEILING (&rceil;, &RightCeiling;)
U+230A ⌊ LEFT FLOOR (&LeftFloor;, &lfloor;)
U+230B ⌋ RIGHT FLOOR (&rfloor;, &RightFloor;)In the LaTeX typesetting system, these symbols can be specified with the \lceil, \rceil, \lfloor,  and \rfloor commands in math mode, and extended in size using \left\lceil, \right\rceil, \left\lfloor, and \right\rfloor as needed.
Some authors define [x] as the round-toward-zero function, so [2.4] = 2 and [−2.4] = −2, and call it the "integer part".

Definition and properties
Given real numbers x and y, integers m and n and the set of integers 
  
    
      
        
          Z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }
  , floor and ceiling may be defined by the equations

  
    
      
        ⌊
        x
        ⌋
        =
        max
        {
        m
        ∈
        
          Z
        
        ∣
        m

        x

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lfloor x\rfloor =\max\{m\in \mathbb {Z} \mid m\leq x\},}
  
  
    
      
        ⌈
        x
        ⌉
        =
        min
        {
        n
        ∈
        
          Z
        
        ∣
        n
        ≥

        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lceil x\rceil =\min\{n\in \mathbb {Z} \mid n\geq x\}.}
  Since there is exactly one integer in a half-open interval of length one, for any real number x, there are unique integers m and n satisfying the equation

    {\displaystyle x-1<m\leq x\leq n<x+1.}
  where 
  
    
      
        ⌊

        =

   and 
  
    
      
        ⌈
        x
        ⌉
        =
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lceil x\rceil =n}
   may also be taken as the definition of floor and ceiling.

  In the language of order theory, the floor function is a residuated mapping, that is, part of a Galois connection: it is the upper adjoint of the function that embeds the integers into the reals.

Monotonicity
Both floor and ceiling functions are the monotonically non-decreasing function:

Relations among the functions
It is clear from the definitions that

  
    
      
        ⌊
        x
        ⌋
        ≤
        ⌈
        x
        ⌉
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lfloor x\rfloor \leq \lceil x\rceil ,}
     with equality if and only if x is an integer, i.e.

  
    
      
        ⌈
        x
        ⌉
        −
        ⌊
        x
        ⌋
        =
        
          
            {
            
              
                
                  0
                
                
                  
                    
                       if 
                    
                  
                  x
                  ∈
                  
                    Z
                  
                
              
              
                
                  1
                
                
                  
                    
                       if 
                    
                  
                  x
                  ∉
                  
                    Z
                  
                
              
            
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lceil x\rceil -\lfloor x\rfloor ={\begin{cases}0&{\mbox{ if }}x\in \mathbb {Z} \\1&{\mbox{ if }}x\not \in \mathbb {Z} \end{cases}}}
  In fact, for integers n, both floor and ceiling functions are the identity:

  
    
      
        ⌊
        n
        ⌋
        =
        ⌈
        n
        ⌉
        =
        n
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lfloor n\rfloor =\lceil n\rceil =n.}
  Negating the argument switches floor and ceiling and changes the sign:

        {

At points of discontinuity, a Fourier series converges to a value that is the average of its limits on the left and the right, unlike the floor, ceiling and fractional part functions: for y fixed and x a multiple of y the Fourier series given converges to y/2, rather than to x mod y = 0. At points of continuity the series converges to the true value.
Using the formula floor(x) = x − {x} gives

Applications
Mod operator
For an integer x and a positive integer y, the modulo operation, denoted by x mod y, gives the value of the remainder when x is divided by y.  This definition can be extended to real x and y, y ≠  0, by the formula

  
    
      
        x
        
          mod
          
            y
          
        
        =
        x
        −
        y
        
          ⌊
          
            
              x
              y
            
          
          ⌋
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x{\bmod {y}}=x-y\left\lfloor {\frac {x}{y}}\right\rfloor .}
  Then it follows from the definition of floor function that this extended operation satisfies many natural properties.  Notably, x mod y is always between 0 and y, i.e.,
if y is positive,

  
    
      
        0
        ≤
        x
        
          mod
          
            y
          
        
        <
        y
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\leq x{\bmod {y}}<y,}
  and if y is negative,

  
    
      
        0
        ≥
        x
        
          mod
          
            y
          
        
        >
        y
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\geq x{\bmod {y}}>y.}

Quadratic reciprocity
Gauss's third proof of quadratic reciprocity, as modified by Eisenstein, has two basic steps.Let p and q be distinct positive odd prime numbers, and let

  
    
      
        m
        =
        
          
            
              p
              −
              1
            
            2
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle m={\frac {p-1}{2}},}
    
  
    
      
        n
        =
        
          
            
              q
              −
              1
            
            2
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle n={\frac {q-1}{2}}.}
  First, Gauss's lemma is used to show that the Legendre symbols are given by

  
    
      
        
          (

                    q
                  
                  p
                
              
              ⌋
            
            +

                  p
                
              
              ⌋
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left({\frac {q}{p}}\right)=(-1)^{\left\lfloor {\frac {q}{p}}\right\rfloor +\left\lfloor {\frac {2q}{p}}\right\rfloor +\dots +\left\lfloor {\frac {mq}{p}}\right\rfloor }}
  and

  
    
      
        
          (

        =
        (
        −
        1
        
          )
          
            
              ⌊
              
                
                  p

              ⌋
            
            +
            
              ⌊
              
                
                  
                    2

                  q
                
              
              ⌋
            
            +
            ⋯

              ⌊

  The second step is to use a geometric argument to show that

Formulas for prime numbers

          ⌊
          
            
              
                n
                −
                1
              
              m

    {\displaystyle \left\lfloor {\frac {n}{m}}\right\rfloor -\left\lfloor {\frac {n-1}{m}}\right\rfloor }
   is equal to 1 if m divides n, and to 0 otherwise, it follows that a positive integer n is a prime if and only if

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            m
            =

            ∞

    {\displaystyle \sum _{m=1}^{\infty }\left(\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{m}}\right\rfloor -\left\lfloor {\frac {n-1}{m}}\right\rfloor \right)=2.}
  One may also give formulas for producing the prime numbers.  For example, let pn be the n-th prime, and for any integer r > 1, define the real number α by the sum

  
    
      
        α
        =
        
          ∑

            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          p
          
            m
          
        
        
          r
          
            −
            
              m

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha =\sum _{m=1}^{\infty }p_{m}r^{-m^{2}}.}
  Then

  A similar result is that there is a number θ = 1.3064... (Mills' constant) with the property that

Computer implementations
In most programming languages, the simplest method to convert a floating point number to an integer does not do floor or ceiling, but truncation. The reason for this is historical, as the first machines used ones' complement and truncation was simpler to implement (floor is simpler in two's complement). FORTRAN was defined to require this behavior and thus almost all processors implement conversion this way. Some consider this to be an unfortunate historical design decision that has led to bugs handling negative offsets and graphics on the negative side of the origin.A bit-wise right-shift of a signed integer 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   by 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is the same as 
  
    
      
        
          ⌊
          
            
              x
              
                2
                
                  n
                
              
            
          
          ⌋
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\lfloor {\frac {x}{2^{n}}}\right\rfloor }
  . Division by a power of 2 is often written as a right-shift, not for optimization as might be assumed, but because the floor of negative results is required. Assuming such shifts are "premature optimization" and replacing them with division can break software.Many programming languages (including C, C++, C#,  Java, PHP, R, and Python) provide standard functions for floor and ceiling, usually called floor and ceil, or less commonly ceiling. The language APL uses ⌊x for floor.  The J Programming Language, a follow-on to APL that is designed to use standard keyboard symbols, uses <. for floor and >. for ceiling.ALGOL usesentier for floor.
In Microsoft Excel the floor function is implemented as INT (which rounds down rather than toward zero). The command FLOOR in earlier versions would round toward zero, effectively the opposite of what "int" and "floor" do in other languages. Since 2010 FLOOR has been fixed to round down, with extra arguments that can reproduce previous behavior. The OpenDocument file format, as used by OpenOffice.org, Libreoffice and others, uses the same function names; INT does floor and FLOOR has a third argument that can make it round toward zero.
