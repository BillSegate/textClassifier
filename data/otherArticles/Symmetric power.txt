In mathematics, the n-th symmetric power of an object X is the quotient of the n-fold product 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            n
          
        
        :=
        X
        ×
        ⋯
        ×
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X^{n}:=X\times \cdots \times X}
   by the permutation action of the symmetric group 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              S
            
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {S}}_{n}}
  .
More precisely, the notion exists at least in the following three areas:

In linear algebra, the n-th symmetric power of a vector space V is the vector subspace of the symmetric algebra of V consisting of degree-n elements (here the product is a tensor product).
In algebraic topology, the n-th symmetric power of a topological space X is the quotient space 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            n
          
        
        
          /
        
        
          
            
              S
            
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X^{n}/{\mathfrak {S}}_{n}}
  , as in the beginning of this article.
In algebraic geometry, a symmetric power is defined in a way similar to that in algebraic topology. For example, if 
  
    
      
        X
        =
        Spec
        ⁡
        (
        A
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle X=\operatorname {Spec} (A)}
   is an affine variety, then the GIT quotient 
  
    
      
        Spec
        ⁡
        (
        (
        A
        
          ⊗
          
            k
          
        
        ⋯
        
          ⊗
          
            k
          
        
        A
        
          )
          
            
              
                
                  S
                
              
              
                n
              
            
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} ((A\otimes _{k}\dots \otimes _{k}A)^{{\mathfrak {S}}_{n}})}
   is the n-th symmetric power of X.
