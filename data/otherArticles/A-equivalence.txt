In mathematics,

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}
  -equivalence, sometimes called right-left equivalence, is an equivalence relation between map germs.
Let 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
    and 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
   be two manifolds, and let 
  
    
      
        f
        ,
        g
        :
        (
        M
        ,
        x
        )
        →
        (
        N
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f,g:(M,x)\to (N,y)}
   be two smooth map germs. We say that 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   and 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   are 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}
  -equivalent if there exist diffeomorphism germs 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        :
        (
        M
        ,
        x
        )
        →
        (
        M
        ,
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi :(M,x)\to (M,x)}
   and 
  
    
      
        ψ
        :
        (
        N
        ,
        y
        )
        →
        (
        N
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi :(N,y)\to (N,y)}
   such that 
  
    
      
        ψ
        ∘
        f
        =
        g
        ∘
        ϕ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi \circ f=g\circ \phi .}
  
In other words, two map germs are 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}
  -equivalent if one can be taken onto the other by a diffeomorphic change of co-ordinates in the source (i.e. 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
  ) and the target (i.e. 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
  ).
Let 
  
    
      
        Ω

    {\displaystyle {\mbox{diff}}(M_{x})}
   be the group of diffeomorphism germs 
  
    
      
        (

        →

   The group 
  
    
      
        G
        :=
        
          
            diff
          
        
        (
        
          M
          
            x
          
        
        )
        ×

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle G:={\mbox{diff}}(M_{x})\times {\mbox{diff}}(N_{y})}
   acts on 
  
    
      
        Ω
        (
        
          M

        ,

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega (M_{x},N_{y})}
   in the natural way: 
  
    
      
        (
        ϕ
        ,
        ψ
        )
        ⋅
        f
        =
        
          ψ
          
            −
            1
          
        
        ∘

        ϕ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\phi ,\psi )\cdot f=\psi ^{-1}\circ f\circ \phi .}
   Under this action we see that the map germs 
  
    
      
        f
        ,
        g
        :
        (

        N
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f,g:(M,x)\to (N,y)}
   are 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}
  -equivalent if, and only if, 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   lies in the orbit of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  , i.e. 
  
    
      
        g
        ∈
        
          
            
              orb
            
          
          
            G
          
        
        (
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\in {\mbox{orb}}_{G}(f)}
   (or vice versa).
A map germ is called stable if its orbit under the action of 
  
    
      
        G
        :=
        
          
            diff
          
        
        (
        
          M
          
            x
          
        
        )
        ×
        
          
            diff
          
        
        (
        
          N
          
            y
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle G:={\mbox{diff}}(M_{x})\times {\mbox{diff}}(N_{y})}
   is open relative to the Whitney topology. Since 
  
    
      
        Ω
        (
        
          M
          
            x
          
        
        ,
        
          N
          
            y
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega (M_{x},N_{y})}
   is an infinite dimensional space metric topology is no longer trivial. Whitney topology compares the differences in successive derivatives and gives a notion of proximity within the infinite dimensional space. A base for the open sets of the topology in question is given by taking 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -jets for every 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   and taking open neighbourhoods in the ordinary Euclidean sense. Open sets in the topology are then unions of
these base sets.
Consider the orbit of some map germ 
  
    
      
        o
        r
        
          b
          
            G
          
        
        (
        f
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle orb_{G}(f).}
   The map germ 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is called simple if there are only finitely many other orbits in a neighbourhood of each of its points. Vladimir Arnold has shown that the only simple singular map germs
