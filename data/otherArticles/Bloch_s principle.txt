Bloch's Principle is a philosophical principle in mathematics
stated by André Bloch.Bloch states the principle in Latin as: Nihil est in infinito quod non prius fuerit in finito, and explains this as follows:  Every proposition in whose statement the actual infinity occurs can be always considered a consequence, almost immediate, of a proposition where it does not occur, a proposition in finite terms.
Bloch mainly applied this principle to the theory of functions of a complex variable.  Thus, for example, according to this principle, Picard's theorem corresponds to Schottky's theorem, and Valiron's theorem corresponds to Bloch's theorem.
Based on his Principle, Bloch was able to predict or conjecture several
important results such as the Ahlfors's Five Islands theorem,
Cartan's theorem on holomorphic curves omitting hyperplanes, Hayman's result that an exceptional set of radii is unavoidable in Nevanlinna theory.
In the more recent times several general theorems were proved which can be regarded as rigorous statements in the spirit of the Bloch Principle:

  Zalcman's lemma may be generalized to several complex variables. First, define the following:
A family

    {\displaystyle \Omega \subset C^{n}}
   is normal in 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }

        ⊆
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{f_{j}\}\subseteq {\mathcal {F}}}

        f
        ≠
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\neq \infty }
   uniformly on each compact subset of 
  
    
      
        Ω
        ,

In particular, for

    {\displaystyle z^{\sharp }}
   coincides with the spherical metric on 
  
    
      
        C
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle C.}
  
The following characterization of normality can be made based on Marty's theorem, which states that a family is normal if and only if the spherical derivatives are locally bounded:Suppose that the family

   Then there exist sequences

to X is constant. Then there exists a metric on X such that every holomorphic map from the unit disc with the Poincaré metric to X does not increase distances.
