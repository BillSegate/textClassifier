The Beraha constants are a series of mathematical constants by which the  
  
    
      
        n
        
          th
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n{\text{th}}}
   Beraha constant is given by

  
    
      
        B
        (
        n
        )
        =
        2
        +
        2
        cos
        ⁡
        
          (

              n
            
          
          )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle B(n)=2+2\cos \left({\frac {2\pi }{n}}\right).}
  Notable examples of Beraha constants include 
  
    
      
        B
        (
        5
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle B(5)}
  is 
  
    
      
        φ
        +
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi +1}
  , where 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   is the golden ratio, 
  
    
      
        B
        (
        7
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle B(7)}
  is the silver constant (also known as the silver root), and 
  
    
      
        B
        (
        10
        )
        =
        φ
        +
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle B(10)=\varphi +2}
  .
