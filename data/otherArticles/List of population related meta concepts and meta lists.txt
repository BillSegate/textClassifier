Outline of demography contains human demography and population related important concepts and high-level aggregated lists compiled in the useful categories.
The subheadings have been grouped by the following 4 categories:

Meta (lit. "highest" level) units, such as the universal important concepts related to demographics and places.
Macro (lit. "high" level) units where the "whole world" is the smallest unit of measurement, such as the aggregated summary demographics at global level. For example, United Nations.
Meso (lit. "middle" or "intermediate" level) units where the smallest unit of measurement cover more than one nation and more than one continent but not all the nations or continents. For example, summary list at continental level, e.g. Eurasia and Latin America or Middle East which cover two or more continents. Other examples include the intercontinental organisations e.g. the Commonwealth of Nations or the organisation of Arab states.
Micro (lit. "lower" or "smaller") level units where country is the smallest unit of measurement, such as the "globally aggregated lists" by the "individual countries" .Please do not add sections on the items that are the nano (lit. "minor" or "tiny") level units as per the context described above, e.g. list of things within a city must be kept out.

Meta or important concepts
Global human population
Impact of human population
Continuation of human species
Sustainable and secure optimum human population
Sustainable food security
Sustainability
Macro or highest level global lists
These are macro (high or top) level lists.

Global lists of historical populations
World summary lists
Meso or intermediate level sub-global lists
These meso (middle or intermediate) level lists are 

"supra-national" (more than one continent "and" more than one nation), but
"sub-global" (but not all nations "or" all continents).

Intercontinental lists
This is aggregated list of demographics and places spanning across more than one continent but not across all the nations.

Summary lists aggregated by continents
This is aggregated list by individual subcontinent.

Asia
This is aggregated list of Asia subcontinent.

Africa
This is aggregated list of Africa subcontinent.

Europe
This is aggregated list of Europe subcontinent.

North America
This is aggregated list of North America subcontinent.

South America
This is aggregated list of South America subcontinent.

Oceania

Micro or lover level global lists
Global lists aggregated by countries
This is "aggregated global" list by countries. Do not put the list of individual countries in his section.

Global lists aggregated by subdivisions of countries
This is aggregated "global" list of subdivisions by countries.

Global lists aggregated by urban areas of countries
This is aggregated "global" list of urban areas by countries.

Lists of individual countries
This is list is related only to individual countries, i.e. create separate subsection for each country. Please help expand this incomplete list by adding more nations.
