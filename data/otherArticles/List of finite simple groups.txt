In mathematics, the classification of finite simple groups states that every finite simple group is cyclic, or alternating, or in one of 16 families of groups of Lie type, or one of 26 sporadic groups.
The list below gives all finite simple groups, together with their order, the size of the Schur multiplier, the size of the outer automorphism group, usually some small representations, and lists of all duplicates.

Summary
The following table is a complete list of the 18 families of finite simple groups and the 26 sporadic simple groups, along with their orders. Any non-simple members of each family are listed, as well as any members duplicated within a family or between families. (In removing duplicates it is useful to note that no two finite simple groups have the same order, except that the group A8 = A3(2) and A2(4) both have order 20160, and that the group Bn(q) has the same order as  Cn(q) for q odd, n > 2. The smallest of the latter pairs of groups are B3(3) and C3(3) which both have order 4585351680.)
There is an unfortunate conflict between the notations for the alternating groups An and the groups of Lie type An(q).  Some authors use various different fonts for An to distinguish them.  In particular,
in this article we make the distinction by setting the alternating groups An in Roman font and the Lie-type groups An(q) in italic.
In what follows, n is a positive integer, and q is a positive power of a prime number p, with the restrictions noted. The notation (a,b) represents the greatest common divisor of the integers a and b.

Cyclic groups, Zp
Simplicity: Simple for p a prime number.
Order: p
Schur multiplier: Trivial.
Outer automorphism group: Cyclic of order p − 1.
Other names: Z/pZ, CpRemarks: These are the only simple groups that are not perfect.

Alternating groups, An, n > 4
Simplicity: Solvable for n < 5, otherwise simple.
Order: n!/2  when n > 1.
Schur multiplier: 2 for n = 5 or n > 7, 6 for n = 6 or 7; see Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups
Outer automorphism group: In general 2.  Exceptions: for n = 1, n = 2, it is trivial, and for n = 6, it has order 4 (elementary abelian).
Other names: Altn.
Isomorphisms: A1 and A2 are trivial. A3 is cyclic of order 3. A4 is isomorphic to A1(3) (solvable).  A5 is isomorphic to A1(4) and to A1(5). A6 is isomorphic to A1(9) and to the derived group B2(2)′. A8 is isomorphic to A3(2).
Remarks: An index 2 subgroup of the symmetric group of permutations of n points when n > 1.

Groups of Lie type
Notation: n is a positive integer,  q > 1 is a power of a prime number p, and is the order of some underlying finite field. The order of the outer automorphism group is written as  d⋅f⋅g, where d is the order of the group of "diagonal automorphisms", f is the order of the (cyclic) group of "field automorphisms" (generated by a Frobenius automorphism), and g is the order of the group of "graph automorphisms" (coming from automorphisms of the Dynkin diagram). The outer automorphism group is often, but not always, isomorphic to the semidirect product
