In the mathematical theory of non-standard positional numeral systems, the Komornik–Loreti constant is a mathematical constant that represents the smallest base q for which the number 1 has a unique representation, called its q-development. The constant is named after Vilmos Komornik and Paola Loreti, who defined it in 1998.

Definition
Given a real number q > 1, the series

  
    
      
        x
        =
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          a

            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }a_{n}q^{-n}}
  is called the q-expansion, or

  -expansion, of the positive real number x if, for all

        0

        q
        ⌋
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\leq a_{n}\leq \lfloor q\rfloor }
  , where 
  
    
      
        ⌊
        q
        ⌋
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lfloor q\rfloor }
   is the floor function and 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{n}}
   need not be an integer. Any real number 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   such that 
  
    
      
        0
        ≤
        x
        ≤
        q

          /
        
        (
        q
        −
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\leq x\leq q\lfloor q\rfloor /(q-1)}
   has such an expansion, as can be found using the greedy algorithm.

  , and 
  
    
      
        
          a

   is sometimes called a 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
  -development.

        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{n}=1}
   gives the only 2-development. However, for almost all

        q
        <
        2

  , there are an infinite number of different 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
  -developments. Even more surprisingly though, there exist exceptional 
  
    
      
        q
        ∈
        (
        1
        ,
        2
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle q\in (1,2)}
   for which there exists only a single 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
  -development. Furthermore, there is a smallest number 
  
    
      
        1
        <
        q
        <
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1<q<2}
   known as the Komornik–Loreti constant for which there exists a unique 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
  -development.
