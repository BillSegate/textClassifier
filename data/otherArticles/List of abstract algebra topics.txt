Abstract algebra is the subject area of mathematics that studies algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, and algebras. The phrase abstract algebra was coined at the turn of the 20th century to distinguish this area from what was normally referred to as algebra, the study of the rules for manipulating formulae and algebraic expressions involving unknowns and real or complex numbers, often now called elementary algebra. The distinction is rarely made in more recent writings.

Basic language
Algebraic structures are defined primarily as sets with operations. 

Algebraic structure
Subobjects: subgroup, subring, subalgebra, submodule etc.
Binary operation
Closure of an operation
Associative property
Distributive property
Commutative property
Unary operator
Additive inverse, multiplicative inverse, inverse element
Identity element
Cancellation property
Finitary operation
ArityStructure preserving maps called homomorphisms are vital in the study of algebraic objects.

Homomorphisms
Kernels and cokernels
Image and coimage
Epimorphisms and monomorphisms
Isomorphisms
Isomorphism theoremsThere are several basic ways to combine algebraic objects of the same type to produce a third object of the same type. These constructions are used throughout algebra.

Direct sum
Direct limit
Direct product
Inverse limit
Quotient objects: quotient group, quotient ring, quotient module etc.
