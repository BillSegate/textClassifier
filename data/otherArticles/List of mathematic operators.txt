In mathematics, an operator or transform is a function from one space of functions to another. Operators occur commonly in engineering, physics and mathematics. Many are integral operators and differential operators.
In the following L is an operator

  
    
      
        L
        :
        
          
            F
          
        
        →
        
          
            G
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L:{\mathcal {F}}\to {\mathcal {G}}}
  which takes a function 
  
    
      
        y
        ∈
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y\in {\mathcal {F}}}
   to another function 
  
    
      
        L
        [
        y
        ]
        ∈
        
          
            G
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L[y]\in {\mathcal {G}}}
  . Here, 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            G
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}}
   are some unspecified function spaces, such as Hardy space, Lp space, Sobolev space, or, more vaguely, the space of holomorphic functions.
