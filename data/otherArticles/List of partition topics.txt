Generally, a partition is a division of a whole into non-overlapping parts.  Among the kinds of partitions considered in mathematics are

partition of a set or an ordered partition of a set,
partition of a graph,
partition of an integer,
partition of an interval,
partition of unity,
partition of a matrix; see block matrix, and
partition of the sum of squares in statistics problems, especially in the analysis of variance,
quotition and partition, two ways of viewing the operation of division of integers.
