In number theory, Niven's constant, named after Ivan Niven, is the largest exponent appearing in the prime factorization of any natural number n "on average". More precisely, if we define H(1) = 1 and H(n) = the largest exponent appearing in the unique prime factorization of a natural number n > 1, then Niven's constant is given by

  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            n
            →
            ∞

            n
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            j
            =
            1

        H
        (

        )
        =
        1
        +
        
          ∑

                  ζ
                  (
                  k
                  )
                
              
            
          
          )
        
        =
        1.705211
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{j=1}^{n}H(j)=1+\sum _{k=2}^{\infty }\left(1-{\frac {1}{\zeta (k)}}\right)=1.705211\dots }
  where ζ is the Riemann zeta function.In the same paper Niven also proved that

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            j

        =

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{n}h(j)=n+c{\sqrt {n}}+o({\sqrt {n}})}
  where h(1) = 1, h(n) = the smallest exponent appearing in the unique prime factorization of each natural number n > 1, o is little o notation, and the constant c is given by

  
    
      
        c
        =

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle c={\frac {\zeta ({\frac {3}{2}})}{\zeta (3)}},}
  and consequently that

            n
