In mathematics, a Nichols algebra is a Hopf algebra in a braided category assigned to an object V in this category (e.g. a braided vector space). The Nichols algebra is a quotient of the tensor algebra of V enjoying a certain universal property and is typically infinite-dimensional. Nichols algebras appear naturally in any pointed Hopf algebra and enabled their classification in important cases. The most well known examples for Nichols algebras are the Borel parts

To any Nichols algebra there is by  attached
a generalized root system and a Weyl groupoid. These are classified in.
In particular several Dynkin diagrams (for inequivalent types of Weyl chambers). Each Dynkin diagram has one vertex per irreducible

        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   and can therefore be realized over many different groups. Sometimes there are two or three Nichols algebras with different 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   and non-isomorphic Nichols algebra, which are closely related (e.g. cocycle twists of each other). These are given by different conjugacy classes in the same column.

State of classification
(as of 2015)

Established classification results
Finite-dimensional diagonal Nichols algebras over the complex numbers were classified by Heckenberger in. The case of arbitrary characteristic is ongoing work of Heckenberger, Wang.
Finite-dimensional Nichols algebras of semisimple Yetter–Drinfel'd modules of rank >1 over finite nonabelian groups (generated by the support) were classified by Heckenberger and Vendramin in.

Negative criteria
The case of rank 1 (irreducible Yetter–Drinfel'd module) over a nonabelian group is still largely open, with few examples known.
Much progress has been made by Andruskiewitsch and others by finding subracks (for example diagonal ones) that would lead to infinite-dimensional Nichols algebras. As of 2015, known groups not admitting finite-dimensional Nichols algebras are

  Usually a large amount of conjugacy classes ae of type D ("not commutative enough"), while the others tend to possess sufficient abelian subracks and can be excluded by their consideration. Several cases have to be done by-hand. Note that the open cases tend to have very small centralizers (usually cyclic) and representations χ (usually the 1-dimensional sign representation). Significant exceptions are the conjugacy classes of order 16, 32 having as centralizers p-groups of order 2048 resp. 128 and currently no restrictions on χ.

Nichols algebras from diagram folding
The following families Nichols algebras were constructed by Lentner using diagram folding, the fourth example appearing only in characteristic 3 was discovered during the classification of Heckenberger and Vendramin.The construction start with a known Nichols algebra (here diagonal ones related to quantum groups) and an additional automorphism of the Dynkin diagram. Hence the two major cases are whether this automorphism exchanges two disconnected copies or is a proper diagram automorphism of a connected Dynkin diagram. The resulting root system is folding / restriction of the original root system. By construction, generators and relations are known from the diagonal case.

The following two are obtained by proper automorphisms of the connected Dynkin diagrams
