In polymer science, inherent viscosity is the ratio of the natural logarithm of the relative viscosity of a polymer to its mass concentration.Inherent viscosity is defined as 
  
    
      
        
          η
          
            i
            n
            h
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              ln
              ⁡
              
                η
                
                  r
                  e
                  l
                
              
            
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \eta _{inh}={\frac {\ln \eta _{rel}}{c}}}
   
where c is the mass concentration of the polymer (g/dL) and 
  
    
      
        
          η
          
            r
            e
            l
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \eta _{rel}}
   is the relative viscosity, which is defined as 

  
    
      
        
          η
          
            r
            e
            l
          
        
        =
        
          
            η
            
              η
              
                s
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \eta _{rel}={\frac {\eta }{\eta _{s}}}}
  
where 
  
    
      
        η
      
    
    {\displaystyle \eta }
   is the viscosity of the solution and 
  
    
      
        
          η
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \eta _{s}}
   is the viscosity of the solvent.
The unit of inherent viscosity is dL/g.
