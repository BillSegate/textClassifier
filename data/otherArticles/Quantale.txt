In mathematics, quantales are certain partially ordered algebraic structures that generalize locales (point free topologies) as well as various multiplicative lattices of ideals from ring theory and functional analysis (C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras). Quantales are sometimes referred to as complete residuated semigroups.

Overview
A quantale is a complete lattice Q with an associative binary operation ∗ : Q × Q → Q, called its multiplication, satisfying a distributive property such that

        ∗
        
          (
          
            
              ⋁
              
                i
                ∈
                I

                  i
                
              
            
          
          )
        
        =
        
          ⋁

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x*\left(\bigvee _{i\in I}{y_{i}}\right)=\bigvee _{i\in I}(x*y_{i})}
  and

  
    
      
        
          (

                  i
                
              
            
          
          )
        
        ∗
        
          x
        
        =
        
          ⋁
          
            i
            ∈
            I
          
        
        (
        
          y
          
            i
          
        
        ∗
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(\bigvee _{i\in I}{y_{i}}\right)*{x}=\bigvee _{i\in I}(y_{i}*x)}
  for all x, yi in Q, i in I (here I is any index set). The quantale is unital if it has an identity element e for its multiplication:

  
    
      
        x
        ∗
        e
        =
        x
        =
        e
        ∗
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x*e=x=e*x}
  for all x in Q. In this case, the quantale is naturally a monoid with respect to its multiplication ∗.
A unital quantale may be defined equivalently as a monoid in the category Sup of complete join semi-lattices.
A unital quantale is an idempotent semiring under join and multiplication.
A unital quantale in which the identity is the top element of the underlying lattice is said to be strictly two-sided (or simply integral).
A commutative quantale is a quantale whose multiplication is commutative. A frame, with its multiplication given by the meet operation, is a typical example of a strictly two-sided commutative quantale. Another simple example is provided by the unit interval together with its usual multiplication.
An idempotent quantale is a quantale whose multiplication is idempotent. A frame is the same as an idempotent strictly two-sided quantale.
An involutive quantale is a quantale with an involution

  A quantale homomorphism is a map f : Q1 → Q2 that preserves joins and multiplication for all x, y, xi in Q1, and i in I:
