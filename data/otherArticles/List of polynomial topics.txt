This is a list of polynomial topics, by Wikipedia page. See also trigonometric polynomial, list of algebraic geometry topics.

Terminology
Degree: The maximum exponents among the monomials.
Factor: An expression being multiplied.
Linear factor: A factor of degree one.
Coefficient: An expression multiplying one of the monomials of the polynomial.
Root (or zero) of a polynomial: Given a polynomial p(x), the x values that satisfy p(x) = 0 are called roots (or zeroes) of the polynomial p.
