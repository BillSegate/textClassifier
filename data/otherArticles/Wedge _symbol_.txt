In Unicode, the symbol is encoded U+2227 ∧ LOGICAL AND (&and;, &wedge;) and by \wedge and \land in TeX. The opposite symbol (∨) is called a vel, or sometimes a (descending) wedge. Some authors who call the descending wedge vel often call the ascending wedge ac (the corresponding Latin word for "and", also spelled "atque"), keeping their usage parallel
