A list of wavelet related transforms:

Continuous wavelet transform (CWT)
Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
Multiresolution analysis (MRA)
Lifting scheme
Binomial QMF (BQMF)
Fast wavelet transform (FWT)
Complex wavelet transform
Non or undecimated wavelet transform, the downsampling is omitted
Newland transform, an orthonormal basis of wavelets is formed from appropriately constructed top-hat filters in frequency space
Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), detail coefficients are decomposed and a variable tree can be formed
Stationary wavelet transform (SWT), no downsampling and the filters at each level are different
e-decimated discrete wavelet transform, depends on if the even or odd coefficients are selected in the downsampling
Second generation wavelet transform (SGWT), filters and wavelets are not created in the frequency domain
Dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), two trees are used for decomposion to produce the real and complex coefficients
WITS: Where Is The Starlet, a collection of a hundredth of wavelet names in -let and associated multiscale, directional, geometric, representations, from activelets to x-lets through bandelets, chirplets, contourlets, curvelets, noiselets, wedgelets ...
