In mathematics, the inverse gamma function 
  
    
      
        
          Γ
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma ^{-1}(x)}
   is the inverse function of the gamma function. In other words, 
  
    
      
        y
        =
        
          Γ
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=\Gamma ^{-1}(x)}
   whenever 
  
    
      
        Γ
        (
        y
        )
        =
        x
      
    
    {\textstyle \Gamma (y)=x}
  . For example, 
  
    
      
        
          Γ
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        24
        )
        =
        5
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma ^{-1}(24)=5}
  . Usually, the inverse gamma function refers to the principal branch with domain on the real interval 
  
    
      
        
          [
          
            β
            ,
            +
            ∞
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left[\beta ,+\infty \right)}
   and image on the real interval 
  
    
      
        
          [
          
            α
            ,
            +
            ∞
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left[\alpha ,+\infty \right)}
  , where 
  
    
      
        β
        =
        0.8856031
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta =0.8856031\ldots }
   is the minimum value of the gamma function on the positive real axis and 
  
    
      
        α
        =
        
          Γ
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        β
        )
        =
        1.4616321
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha =\Gamma ^{-1}(\beta )=1.4616321\ldots }
   is the location of that minimum.

Definition
The inverse gamma function may be defined by the following integral representation
where 
  
    
      
        μ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu (t)}
   is a Borel measure such that  and 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   are real numbers with 
  
    
      
        b
        ≧
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\geqq 0}
  .

Approximation
To compute the branches of the inverse gamma function one can first compute the Taylor series of  
  
    
      
        Γ
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma (x)}
   near 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  . The series can then be truncated and inverted, which yields successively better approximations to 
  
    
      
        
          Γ
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma ^{-1}(x)}
  . For instance, we have the quadratic approximation: 
The inverse gamma function also has the following asymptotic formula
where 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            0
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle W_{0}(x)}
   is the Lambert W function. The formula is found by inverting the Stirling approximation, and so can also be expanded into an asymptotic series.

Series expansion
To obtain a series expansion of the inverse gamma function one can first compute the series expansion of the reciprocal gamma function 
  
    
      
        
          
            1
            
              Γ
              (
              x
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\Gamma (x)}}}
   near the poles at the negative integers, and then invert the series. 
Setting 
  
    
      
        z
        =
        
          
            1
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle z={\frac {1}{x}}}
   then yields, for the n th branch 
  
    
      
        
          Γ
          
            n
          
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma _{n}^{-1}(z)}
   of the inverse gamma function (
  
    
      
        n
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\geq 0}
  )
where 
  
    
      
        
          ψ
          
            (
            n
            )
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi ^{(n)}(x)}
   is the polygamma function.
