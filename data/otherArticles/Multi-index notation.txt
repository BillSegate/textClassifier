Multi-index notation is a mathematical notation that simplifies formulas used in multivariable calculus, partial differential equations and the theory of distributions, by generalising the concept of an integer index to an ordered tuple of indices.

Definition and basic properties

Multi-binomial theorem
 Note that, since x + y is a vector and α is a multi-index, the expression on the left is short for (x1 + y1)α1⋯(xn + yn)αn.

An example theorem
If 
  
    
      
        α
        ,
        β
        ∈
        
          
            N
          
          
            0
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha ,\beta \in \mathbb {N} _{0}^{n}}
   are multi-indices and 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        (
        
          x
          
            1

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})}
  , then

Proof
The proof follows from the power rule for the ordinary derivative; if α and β are in 
  
    
      
        {
        0
        ,
        1

        ,
        …
        }
      
    
    {\textstyle \{0,1,2,\ldots \}}

Suppose 
  
    
      
        α
        =

          α
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha =(\alpha _{1},\ldots ,\alpha _{n})}
  , 
  
    
      
        β
        =
        (
        
          β
          
            1
          
        
        ,

        ,
        
          β
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta =(\beta _{1},\ldots ,\beta _{n})}
  , and 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        (

        ,

        ,
        
          x

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})}
  . Then we have that

        i
      
    
    {\textstyle i}

        ,
        n
        }
      
    
    {\textstyle \{1,\ldots ,n\}}
  , the function 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
          
            
              β
              
                i
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}^{\beta _{i}}}
   only depends on 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}}
  . In the above, each partial differentiation 
  
    
      
        ∂
        
          /
        
        ∂
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \partial /\partial x_{i}}
   therefore reduces to the corresponding ordinary differentiation 
  
    
      
        d
        
          /
        
        d

            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle d/dx_{i}}
  . Hence, from equation (1), it follows that 
  
    
      
        
          ∂
          
            α
          
        
        
          x
          
            β
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \partial ^{\alpha }x^{\beta }}
   vanishes if 
  
    
      
        
          α
          
            i
          
        
        >
        
          β
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle \alpha _{i}>\beta _{i}}
   for at least one 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\textstyle i}
   in

        n
        }
      
    
    {\textstyle \{1,\ldots ,n\}}
  . If this is not the case, i.e., if 
  
    
      
        α
        ≤
        β
      
    
    {\textstyle \alpha \leq \beta }
