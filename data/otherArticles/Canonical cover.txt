A canonical cover 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   for F (a set of functional dependencies on a relation scheme) is a set of dependencies such that F logically implies all dependencies in 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
  , and 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   logically implies all dependencies in F.
The set 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   has two important properties:

No functional dependency in 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   contains an extraneous attribute.
Each left side of a functional dependency in 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   is unique. That is, there are no two dependencies 
  
    
      
        a
        →
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\to b}
   and 
  
    
      
        c
        →
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\to d}
   in 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   such that 
  
    
      
        a
        =
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=c}
  .A canonical cover is not unique for a given set of functional dependencies, therefore one set F can have multiple covers 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
  .

Canonical cover example
In the following example, Fc is the canonical cover of F.
Given the following, we can find the canonical cover: R = (A, B, C, G, H, I) F = {A→BC, B→C, A→B, AB→C}

{A→BC, B→C, A→B, AB→C}
{A → BC, B →C, AB → C}
{A → BC, B → C}
{A → B, B →C}Fc =  {A → B, B →C}

Extraneous Attributes
An attribute is extraneous in a functional dependency if its removal from that functional dependency does not alter the closure of any attributes.

Extraneous Determinant Attributes
Given a set of functional dependencies 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   and a functional dependency 
  
    
      
        A
        →
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\rightarrow B}
   in 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
  , the attribute 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is extraneous in 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   if 
  
    
      
        a
        ⊂
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\subset A}
   and any of the functional dependencies in 
  
    
      
        (
        F
        −
        (
        A
        →
        B
        )
        ∪
        
          (
          A
          −
          a
          )
          →
          B
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (F-(A\rightarrow B)\cup {(A-a)\rightarrow B})}
   can be implied by 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   using Armstrong's Axioms.Using an alternate method, given the set of functional dependencies 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
  , and a functional dependency X → A in 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
  , attribute Y is extraneous in X if 
  
    
      
        Y
        ⊆
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y\subseteq X}
  , and 
  
    
      
        (
        X
        −
        Y
        
          )
          
            +
          
        
        ⊇
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle (X-Y)^{+}\supseteq A}
  .For example:

If F = {A → C, AB → C}, B is extraneous in AB → C because A → C can be inferred even after deleting B. This is true because if A functionally determines C, then AB also functionally determines C.
If F = {A → D, D → C, AB → C}, B is extraneous in AB → C because {A → D, D → C, AB → C} logically implies A → C.

Extraneous Dependent Attributes
Given a set of functional dependencies 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   and a functional dependency 
  
    
      
        A
        →
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\rightarrow B}
   in 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
  , the attribute 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is extraneous in 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   if 
  
    
      
        a
        ⊂
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\subset A}
   and any of the functional dependencies in 
  
    
      
        (
        F
        −
        (
        A
        →
        B
        )
        ∪
        {
        A
        →
        (
        B
        −
        a
        )
        }
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (F-(A\rightarrow B)\cup \{A\rightarrow (B-a)\})}
   can be implied by 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   using Armstrong's Axioms.A dependent attribute of a functional dependency is extraneous if we can remove it without changing the closure of the set of determinant attributes in that functional dependency.For example:

If F = {A → C, AB → CD}, C is extraneous in AB → CD because AB → C can be inferred even after deleting C.
If F = {A → BC, B → C}, C is extraneous in A → BC because A → C can be inferred even after deleting C.
