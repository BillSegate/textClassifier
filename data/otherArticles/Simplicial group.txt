In mathematics, more precisely, in the theory of simplicial sets, a simplicial group is a simplicial object in the category of groups. Similarly, a simplicial abelian group is a simplicial object in the category of abelian groups. A simplicial group is a Kan complex (in particular, its homotopy groups make sense). The Dold–Kan correspondence says that a simplicial abelian group may be identified with a chain complex. In fact it can be shown that
any simplicial abelian group 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is non-canonically homotopy equivalent to a product of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces, 
  
    
      
        
          ∏
          
            i
            ≥
            0
          
        
        K
        (
        
          π
          
            i
          
        
        A
        ,
        i
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \prod _{i\geq 0}K(\pi _{i}A,i).}
  A commutative monoid in the category of simplicial abelian groups is a simplicial commutative ring.
Eckmann (1945) discusses a simplicial analogue of the fact that a cohomology class on a Kähler manifold has a unique harmonic representative and deduces Kirchhoff's circuit laws from these observations.
