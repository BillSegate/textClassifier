In mathematics, the Riemann zeta function is a function in complex analysis, which is also important in number theory. It is often denoted 
  
    
      
        ζ
        (
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \zeta (s)}
   and is named after the mathematician Bernhard Riemann. When the argument 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is a real number greater than one, the zeta function satisfies the equation

It can therefore provide the sum of various convergent infinite series, such as 
  
    
      
        ζ
        (
        2
        )
        =
        
          
            1
            
              1
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        +
      
    
    {\textstyle \zeta (2)={\frac {1}{1^{2}}}+}
  
  
    
      
        
          
            1
            
              2
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        +
      
    
    {\textstyle {\frac {1}{2^{2}}}+}

                2
              
            
          
        
        +
        …
        
        .
      
    
    {\textstyle {\frac {1}{3^{2}}}+\ldots \,.}
   Explicit or numerically efficient formulae exist for 
  
    
      
        ζ
        (
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \zeta (s)}
   at integer arguments, all of which have real values, including this example. This article lists these formulae, together with tables of values. It also includes derivatives and some series composed of the zeta function at integer arguments.
The same equation in 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   above also holds when 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is a complex number whose real part is greater than one, ensuring that the infinite sum still converges. The zeta function can then be extended to the whole of the complex plane by analytic continuation, except for a simple pole at 
  
    
      
        s
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle s=1}
  . The complex derivative exists in this more general region, making the zeta function a meromorphic function. The above equation no longer applies for these extended values of 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  , for which the corresponding summation would diverge. For example, the full zeta function exists at 
  
    
      
        s
        =
        −
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle s=-1}
   (and is therefore finite there), but the corresponding series would be 
  
    
      
        1
        +
        2
        +
        3
        +
        …
        
        ,
      
    
    {\textstyle 1+2+3+\ldots \,,}
   whose partial sums would grow indefinitely large.
The zeta function values listed below include function values at the negative even numbers (s = −2, −4, etc.), for which ζ(s) = 0 and which make up the so-called trivial zeros. The Riemann zeta function article includes a colour plot illustrating how the function varies over a continuous rectangular region of the complex plane. The successful characterisation of its non-trivial zeros in the wider plane is important in number theory, because of the Riemann hypothesis.

The Riemann zeta function at 0 and 1
At zero, one has

At 1 there is a pole, so ζ(1) is not finite but the left and right limits are:

Since it is a pole of first order, it has a complex residue

Positive integers
Even positive integers
For the even positive integers 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  , one has the relationship to the Bernoulli numbers:

The computation of 
  
    
      
        ζ
        (
        2
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \zeta (2)}
   is known as the Basel problem. The value of 
  
    
      
        ζ
        (
        4
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \zeta (4)}
   is related to the Stefan–Boltzmann law and Wien approximation in physics. The first few values are given by:

Taking the limit 
  
    
      
        n
        →
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\rightarrow \infty }
  , one obtains 
  
    
      
        ζ
        (
        ∞
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \zeta (\infty )=1}
  .

The relationship between zeta at the positive even integers and the Bernoulli numbers may be written as

   and

   are integers for all even 
  
    
      
        n

  . These are given by the integer sequences OEIS: A002432 and OEIS: A046988, respectively, in OEIS.  Some of these values are reproduced below:

If we let

    {\displaystyle \pi ^{2n}}
   as above,

then we find recursively,

This recurrence relation may be derived from that for the Bernoulli numbers.
Also, there is another recurrence:

which can be proved, using that

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\cot(x)=-1-\cot ^{2}(x)}
  
The values of the zeta function at non-negative even integers have the generating function:

Since 
 
The formula also shows that for  
  
    
      
        n
        ∈
        
          N

    {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} ,n\rightarrow \infty }
  ,

Odd positive integers
The sum of the harmonic series is infinite.

The value ζ(3) is also known as Apéry's constant and has a role in the electron's gyromagnetic ratio.
The value ζ(3) also appears in Planck's law.
These and additional values are:

It is known that ζ(3) is irrational (Apéry's theorem) and that infinitely many of the numbers ζ(2n + 1) : n ∈ 
  
    
      
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }
   , are irrational. There are also results on the irrationality of values of the Riemann zeta function at the elements of certain subsets of the positive odd integers; for example, at least one of ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), or ζ(11) is irrational.The positive odd integers of the zeta function appear in physics, specifically correlation functions of antiferromagnetic XXX spin chain.Most of the identities following below are provided by Simon Plouffe. They are notable in that they converge quite rapidly, giving almost three digits of precision per iteration, and are thus useful for high-precision calculations.
Plouffe stated the following identities without proof. Proofs were later given by other authors.

ζ(5)
ζ(7)
Note that the sum is in the form of a Lambert series.

ζ(2n + 1)
By defining the quantities

a series of relationships can be given in the form

where An, Bn, Cn and Dn are positive integers. Plouffe gives a table of values:

These integer constants may be expressed as sums over Bernoulli numbers, as given in (Vepstas, 2006) below.
A fast algorithm for the calculation of Riemann's zeta function for any integer argument is given by E. A. Karatsuba.

Negative integers
In general, for negative integers (and also zero), one has

The so-called "trivial zeros" occur at the negative even integers:
 (Ramanujan summation)
The first few values for negative odd integers are

However, just like the Bernoulli numbers, these do not stay small for increasingly negative odd values. For details on the first value, see 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + · · ·.
So ζ(m) can be used as the definition of all (including those for index 0 and 1) Bernoulli numbers.

Derivatives
The derivative of the zeta function at the negative even integers is given by

The first few values of which are

One also has

where A is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.  The first of these identities implies that the regularized product of the reciprocals of the positive integers is

Series involving ζ(n)
The following sums can be derived from the generating function:

where ψ0 is the digamma function.

Series related to the Euler–Mascheroni constant (denoted by γ) are

and using the principal value 

which of course affects only the value at 1, these formulae can be stated as

and show that they depend on the principal value of ζ(1) = γ .

Nontrivial zeros
Zeros of the Riemann zeta except negative even integers are called "nontrivial zeros". The Riemann hypothesis states that the real part of every nontrivial zero must be 1/2. In other words, all known nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta are of the form z = 1/2 + yi where y is a real number. The following table contains the decimal expansion of Im(z) for the first few nontrivial zeros:

Andrew Odlyzko computed the first 2 million nontrivial zeros accurate to within 4×10−9, and the first 100 zeros accurate within 1000 decimal places. See their website for the tables and bibliographies.
A table of about 103 billion zeros with high precision (of ±2-102≈±2·10-31) is available for interactive access and download (although in a very inconvenient compressed format) via LMFDB.

Ratios
Although evaluating particular values of the zeta function is difficult, often certain ratios can be found by inserting particular values of the gamma function into the functional equation
