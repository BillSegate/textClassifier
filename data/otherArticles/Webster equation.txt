The Webster equation, proposed by Thomas J. Webster, is a mathematical model used to predict the adsorption of proteins onto biomaterial surfaces.It takes into account the chemical and physical properties of the biomaterial surface, as well as the characteristics of the protein being adsorbed.

The equation is

  Es = implant surface energy you want to adsorb the proteins you want
reff = implant surface roughness
E0,s = starting implant surface energy  before nanoscale surface modification
r = empirical factor
S = surface area  x, y, z = directions
N = number of measurements

Application
The Webster equation predicts the optimal nanofeatures an implant should have to promote tissue growth, reduce infection, limit inflammation, or control other biological functions. It can be used to design implants that are customized to meet specific biological requirements.
