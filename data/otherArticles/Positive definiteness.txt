In mathematics, positive definiteness is a property of any object to which a bilinear form or a sesquilinear form may be naturally associated, which is positive-definite. See, in particular:

Positive-definite bilinear form
Positive-definite function
Positive-definite function on a group
Positive-definite functional
Positive-definite kernel
Positive-definite matrix
Positive-definite quadratic form
