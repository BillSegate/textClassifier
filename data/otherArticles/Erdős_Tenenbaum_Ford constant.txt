The Erdős–Tenenbaum–Ford constant is a mathematical constant that appears in number theory. Named after mathematicians Paul Erdős, Gérald Tenenbaum, and Kevin Ford, it is defined as

  
    
      
        δ
        :=
        1
        −
        
          
            
              1
              +
              log
              ⁡
              log
              ⁡
              2
            
            
              log
              ⁡
              2
            
          
        
        =
        0.0860713320
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta :=1-{\frac {1+\log \log 2}{\log 2}}=0.0860713320\dots }
  where 
  
    
      
        log
      
    
    {\displaystyle \log }
   is the natural logarithm.
Following up on earlier work by Tenenbaum, Ford used this constant in analyzing the number 
  
    
      
        H
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle H(x,y,z)}
   of integers that are at most 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and that have a divisor in the range 
  
    
      
        [
        y
        ,
        z
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [y,z]}
  .

Multiplication table problem
For each positive integer 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
  , let 
  
    
      
        M
        (
        N
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle M(N)}
   be the number of distinct integers in an 
  
    
      
        N
        ×
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N\times N}
   multiplication table. In 1960, Erdős studied the asymptotic behavior of 
  
    
      
        M
        (
        N
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle M(N)}
   and proved that

  
    
      
        M
        (
        N
        )
        =
        
          
            
              N
              
                2
              
            
            
              (
              log
              ⁡
              N
              
                )

                  )
                
              
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle M(N)={\frac {N^{2}}{(\log N)^{\delta +o(1)}}},}
  as 
  
    
      
        N
        →
        +
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle N\to +\infty }
