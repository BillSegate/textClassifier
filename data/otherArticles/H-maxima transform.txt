In mathematical morphology, the h-maxima transform is a morphological operation used to filter local maxima of an image based on local contrast information. First, all local maxima are defined as connected pixels in a given neighborhood with intensity level greater than pixels outside the neighborhood. Second, all local maxima that have height 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   lower or equal to a given threshold are suppressed. The height f of the remaining maxima is decreased by 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
  .
The h-maxima transform is defined as the reconstruction by dilation of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   from 
  
    
      
        f
        −
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle f-h}
  :

  
    
      
        
          HMAX
          
            h
          
        
        ⁡
        (
        f
        )
        =
        
          R
          
            f
          
          
            δ
          
        
        (
        f
        −
        h
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {HMAX} _{h}(f)=R_{f}^{\delta }(f-h)}
