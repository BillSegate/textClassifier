In lattice field theory, overlap fermions are a fermion discretization that allows to avoid the fermion doubling problem. They are a realisation of Ginsparg–Wilson fermions.
Initially introduced by Neuberger in 1998, they were quickly taken up for a variety of numerical simulations. By now overlap fermions are well established and regularly used in non-perturbative fermion simulations, for instance in lattice QCD.Overlap fermions with mass

  and decouple.
Overlap fermions do not contradict the Nielsen–Ninomiya theorem because they explicitly violate chiral symmetry (obeying the Ginsparg–Wilson equation) and locality.
