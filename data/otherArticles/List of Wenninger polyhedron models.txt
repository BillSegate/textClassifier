This is an indexed list of the uniform and stellated polyhedra from the book Polyhedron Models, by Magnus Wenninger.
The book was written as a guide book to building polyhedra as physical models. It includes templates of face elements for construction and helpful hints in building, and also brief descriptions on the theory behind these shapes. It contains the 75 nonprismatic uniform polyhedra, as well as 44 stellated forms of the convex regular and quasiregular polyhedra.
Models listed here can be cited as "Wenninger Model Number N", or WN for brevity.
The polyhedra are grouped in 5 tables: Regular (1–5), Semiregular (6–18), regular star polyhedra (20–22,41), Stellations and compounds (19–66), and uniform star polyhedra (67–119). The four regular star polyhedra are listed twice because they belong to both the uniform polyhedra and stellation groupings.

Platonic solids (regular convex polyhedra) W1 to W5
Archimedean solids (Semiregular) W6 to W18
