The prime constant is the real number 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   whose 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  th binary digit is 1 if 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is prime and 0 if 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is composite or 1.
In other words, 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   is the number whose binary expansion corresponds to the indicator function of the set of prime numbers.  That is,

  
    
      
        ρ
        =
        
          ∑
          
            p
          
        
        
          
            1
            
              2
              
                p
              
            
          
        
        =
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          
            
              
                χ
                
                  
                    P
                  
                
              
              (
              n
              )
            
            
              2
              
                n
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho =\sum _{p}{\frac {1}{2^{p}}}=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {\chi _{\mathbb {P} }(n)}{2^{n}}}}
  where 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   indicates a prime and 
  
    
      
        
          χ
          
            
              P
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathbb {P} }}
   is the characteristic function of the set 
  
    
      
        
          P
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} }
   of prime numbers.
The beginning of the decimal expansion of ρ is: 
  
    
      
        ρ
        =
        0.414682509851111660248109622
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho =0.414682509851111660248109622\ldots }
   (sequence A051006 in the OEIS)
The beginning of the binary expansion is: 
  
    
      
        ρ
        =
        0.011010100010100010100010000
        
          …

   (sequence A010051 in the OEIS)

Irrationality
The number 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   can be shown to be irrational.  To see why, suppose it were rational.
Denote the 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  th digit of the binary expansion of 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   by 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{k}}
  .  Then since 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   is assumed rational, its binary expansion is eventually periodic, and so there exist positive integers 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
   and 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   such that

  
    
      
        
          r
          
            n
          
        
        =
        
          r
          
            n
            +
            i
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{n}=r_{n+ik}}
   for all 
  
    
      
        n
        >
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle n>N}
   and all 
  
    
      
        i
        ∈
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\in \mathbb {N} }
  .
Since there are an infinite number of primes, we may choose a prime 
  
    
      
        p
        >
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle p>N}
  .  By definition we see that 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            p
          
        
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{p}=1}
  .  As noted, we have 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            p
          
        
        =
        
          r
          
            p
            +
            i
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{p}=r_{p+ik}}
   for all 
  
    
      
        i
        ∈
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\in \mathbb {N} }
  .  Now consider the case 
  
    
      
        i
        =
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle i=p}
  .  We have 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            p
            +
            i
            ⋅
            k
          
        
        =
        
          r
          
            p
            +
            p
            ⋅
            k
          
        
        =
        
          r
          
            p
            (
            k
            +
            1
            )
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{p+i\cdot k}=r_{p+p\cdot k}=r_{p(k+1)}=0}
  , since 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        k
        +
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(k+1)}
   is composite because 
  
    
      
        k
        +
        1
        ≥
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle k+1\geq 2}
  .  Since 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            p
          
        
        ≠
        
          r
          
            p
            (
            k
            +
            1
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{p}\neq r_{p(k+1)}}
   we see that 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   is irrational.
