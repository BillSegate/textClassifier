The Rankine vortex is a simple mathematical model of a vortex in a viscous fluid. It is named after its discoverer, William John Macquorn Rankine.
The vortices observed in nature are usually modelled with an irrotational (potential or free) vortex. However, in potential vortex, the velocity becomes infinite at the vortex center. In reality, very close to the origin, the motion resembles a solid body rotation. The Rankine vortex model assumes a solid-body rotation inside a cylinder of radius 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and a potential vortex outside the cylinder. The radius 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is referred to as the vortex-core radius. The velocity components

  At all points inside the core of the Rankine vortex, the vorticity is uniform at twice the angular velocity of the core; whereas vorticity is zero at all points outside the core because the flow there is irrotational.
In reality, vortex cores are not always circular; and vorticity is not exactly uniform throughout the vortex core.
