In mathematics, a universal space is a certain metric space that contains all metric spaces whose dimension is bounded by some fixed constant. A similar definition exists in topological dynamics.

Definition
Given a class 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              C
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle {\mathcal {C}}}
   of topological spaces, 
  
    
      
        
          
            U
          
          ∈
          
            
              C
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle \mathbb {U} \in {\mathcal {C}}}
   is universal for 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              C
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle {\mathcal {C}}}
   if each member of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              C
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle {\mathcal {C}}}
   embeds in 
  
    
      
        
          
            U
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle \mathbb {U} }
  . Menger stated and proved the case 
  
    
      
        
          d
          =
          1
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle d=1}
   of the following theorem. The theorem in full generality was proven by Nöbeling.
Theorem:
The 
  
    
      
        
          (
          2
          d
          +
          1
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle (2d+1)}
  -dimensional cube 
  
    
      
        
          [
          0
          ,
          1
          
            ]
            
              2
              d
              +
              1
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle [0,1]^{2d+1}}
   is universal for the class of compact metric spaces  whose Lebesgue covering dimension is less than 
  
    
      
        
          d
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle d}
  .
Nöbeling went further and proved:
Theorem: The subspace of 
  
    
      
        
          [
          0
          ,
          1
          
            ]
            
              2
              d
              +
              1
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle [0,1]^{2d+1}}
   consisting of set of points, at most 
  
    
      
        
          d
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle d}
   of whose coordinates are rational, is universal for the class of separable metric spaces whose Lebesgue covering dimension is less than 
  
    
      
        
          d
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle d}
  .
The last theorem was generalized by Lipscomb to the class of metric spaces of weight 
  
    
      
        
          α
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle \alpha }
  , 
  
    
      
        
          α
          >
          
            ℵ
            
              0
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle \alpha >\aleph _{0}}
  : There exist a one-dimensional metric space 
  
    
      
        
          
            J
            
              α
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle J_{\alpha }}
   such that the subspace of 
  
    
      
        
          
            J
            
              α
            
            
              2
              d
              +
              1
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle J_{\alpha }^{2d+1}}
   consisting of set of points, at most 
  
    
      
        
          d
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle d}
   of whose coordinates are "rational" (suitably defined), is universal for the class of metric spaces whose Lebesgue covering dimension is less than 
  
    
      
        
          d
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle d}
   and whose weight is less than 
  
    
      
        
          α
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle \alpha }
  .

Universal spaces in topological dynamics
Consider the category of topological dynamical systems 
  
    
      
        
          (
          X
          ,
          T
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle (X,T)}
   consisting of a compact metric space 
  
    
      
        
          X
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle X}
   and a homeomorphism 
  
    
      
        
          T
          :
          X
          →
          X
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle T:X\rightarrow X}
  . The topological dynamical system 
  
    
      
        
          (
          X
          ,
          T
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle (X,T)}
   is called minimal if it has no proper non-empty closed 
  
    
      
        
          T
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle T}
  -invariant subsets. It is called infinite if 
  
    
      
        
          
            |
          
          X
          
            |
          
          =
          ∞
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle |X|=\infty }
  . A topological dynamical system 
  
    
      
        
          (
          Y
          ,
          S
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle (Y,S)}
   is called a factor of 
  
    
      
        
          (
          X
          ,
          T
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle (X,T)}
   if there exists a continuous surjective mapping 
  
    
      
        
          φ
          :
          X
          →
          Y
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle \varphi :X\rightarrow Y}
   which is equivariant, i.e. 
  
    
      
        
          φ
          (
          T
          x
          )
          =
          S
          φ
          (
          x
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle \varphi (Tx)=S\varphi (x)}
   for all 
  
    
      
        
          x
          ∈
          X
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle x\in X}
  .
Similarly to the definition above, given a class 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              C
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle {\mathcal {C}}}
   of topological dynamical systems, 
  
    
      
        
          
            U
          
          ∈
          
            
              C

    {\displaystyle \textstyle {\mathcal {C}}}
   if each member of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              C

    {\displaystyle \textstyle \mathbb {U} }
   through an equivariant continuous mapping. Lindenstrauss proved the following theorem:

is universal for the class of compact metric topological dynamical systems whose mean dimension is strictly less than

In the same article Lindenstrauss asked what is the largest constant

  . The question was answered by Lindenstrauss and Tsukamoto who showed that

  . Thus the answer is  
  
    
      
        
          c
          =
          
            
              1
              2
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \textstyle c={\frac {1}{2}}}
  .
