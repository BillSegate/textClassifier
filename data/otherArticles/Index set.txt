In mathematics, an index set is a set whose members label (or index) members of another set. For instance, if the elements of a set A may be indexed or labeled by means of the elements of a set J, then J is an index set. The indexing consists of a surjective function from J onto A, and the indexed collection is typically called an indexed family, often written as {Aj}j∈J.

Examples
An enumeration of a set S gives an index set 
  
    
      
        J
        ⊂
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle J\subset \mathbb {N} }
  , where f : J → S is the particular enumeration of S.
Any countably infinite set can be (injectively) indexed by the set of natural numbers 
  
    
      
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }
  .
For 
  
    
      
        r
        ∈
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r\in \mathbb {R} }
  , the indicator function on r is the function 
  
    
      
        
          
            1
          
          
            r
          
        
        :
        
          R
        
        →
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {1} _{r}\colon \mathbb {R} \to \{0,1\}}
   given by The set of all such indicator functions, 
  
    
      
        {
        
          
            1
          
          
            r
          
        
        
          }
          
            r
            ∈
            
              R
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{\mathbf {1} _{r}\}_{r\in \mathbb {R} }}
   , is an uncountable set indexed by 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  .

Other uses
In computational complexity theory and cryptography, an index set is a set for which there exists an algorithm I that can sample the set efficiently; e.g., on input 1n, I can efficiently select a poly(n)-bit long element from the set.
