The Norwegian Mathematical Society (Norwegian: Norsk matematisk forening, NMF) is a professional society for mathematicians. It was formed in 1918, with Carl Størmer elected as its first president.
It organizes mathematical contests and the annual  Abel symposium and also awards the Viggo Brun Prize to young Norwegian mathematicians for outstanding research in mathematics, including mathematical aspects of information technology, mathematical physics, numerical analysis, and computational science. The 2018 Prize winner was Rune Gjøringbø Haugseng. 
The NMF is a member of the International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and provides the Norwegian National Committee in the International Mathematical Union.
