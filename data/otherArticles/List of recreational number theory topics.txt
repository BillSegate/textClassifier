This is a list of recreational number theory topics (see number theory, recreational mathematics). Listing here is not pejorative: many famous topics in number theory have origins in challenging problems posed purely for their own sake.
See list of number theory topics for pages dealing with aspects of number theory with more consolidated theories.
