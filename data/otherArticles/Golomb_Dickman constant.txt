In mathematics, the Golomb–Dickman constant arises in the theory of random permutations and in number theory. Its value is

  
    
      
        λ
        =
        0.62432998854355087099293638310083724
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda =0.62432998854355087099293638310083724\dots }
   (sequence A084945 in the OEIS)It is not known whether this constant is rational or irrational.

Definitions
Let an be the average — taken over all permutations of a set of size n — of the length of the longest cycle in each permutation.  Then the Golomb–Dickman constant is

  
    
      
        λ
        =
        
          lim
          
            n
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          
            
              a
              
                n
              
            
            n
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda =\lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {a_{n}}{n}}.}
  In the language of probability theory, 
  
    
      
        λ
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda n}
   is asymptotically the expected length of the longest cycle in a uniformly distributed random permutation of a set of size n.
In number theory, the Golomb–Dickman constant appears in connection with the average size of the largest prime factor of an integer. More precisely,

  
    
      
        λ
        =
        
          lim
          
            n
            →
            ∞

          ∑
          
            k
            =
            2
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          
            
              log
              ⁡
              (
              
                P
                
                  1
                
              
              (
              k
              )
              )
            
            
              log
              ⁡
              (
              k
              )
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda =\lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{k=2}^{n}{\frac {\log(P_{1}(k))}{\log(k)}},}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            1
          
        
        (
        k
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{1}(k)}
   is the largest prime factor of k (sequence A006530 in the OEIS) . So if k is a d digit integer, then 
  
    
      
        λ
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda d}
   is the asymptotic average number of digits of the largest prime factor of k.
The Golomb–Dickman constant appears in number theory in a different way.   What is the
probability that second largest prime factor of n is smaller than the square root of the largest prime factor of n?  Asymptotically, this probability is 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
  .
More precisely,

  
    
      
        λ
        =
        
          lim
          
            n
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          Prob
        
        
          {
          
            
              P
              
                2

            n
            )

                (
                n
                )
              
            
          
          }
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda =\lim _{n\to \infty }{\text{Prob}}\left\{P_{2}(n)\leq {\sqrt {P_{1}(n)}}\right\}}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            2
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{2}(n)}
   is the second largest prime factor n.
The Golomb-Dickman constant also arises when we consider the average length of the largest cycle of any function from a finite set to itself.   If X is a finite set, if we repeatedly apply a function f: X → X to any element x of this set, it eventually enters a cycle, meaning that for some k we have 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            n
            +
            k
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{n+k}(x)=f^{n}(x)}
   for sufficiently large n; the smallest k with this property is the length of the cycle. Let bn be the average, taken over all functions from a set of size n to itself, of the length of the largest cycle.  Then Purdom and Williams proved that

  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            n
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          
            
              b
              
                n
              
            
            
              n
            
          
        
        =

    {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {b_{n}}{\sqrt {n}}}={\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2}}}\lambda .}
