This article lists some properties of sets of real numbers. The general study of these concepts forms descriptive set theory, which has a rather different emphasis from general topology.

Definability properties
Borel set  
Analytic set  
C-measurable set  
Projective set  
Inductive set  
Infinity-Borel set  
Suslin set  
Homogeneously Suslin set  
Weakly homogeneously Suslin set  
Set of uniqueness

Regularity properties
Property of Baire  
Lebesgue measurable  
Universally measurable set  
Perfect set property  
Universally Baire set

Largeness and smallness properties
Meager set  
Comeager set - A comeager set is one whose complement is meager.
Null set  
Conull set  
Dense set  
Nowhere dense set
