In mathematics, Fatou components are components of the Fatou set.  They were named after Pierre Fatou.

Rational case
If f is a rational function

  
    
      
        f
        =
        
          
            
              P
              (
              z
              )
            
            
              Q
              (
              z
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f={\frac {P(z)}{Q(z)}}}
  defined in the extended complex plane, and if it is a nonlinear function (degree > 1)

  
    
      
        d
        (
        f
        )
        =
        max
        (
        deg
        ⁡
        (
        P
        )
        ,
        
        deg
        ⁡
        (
        Q
        )
        )
        ≥
        2
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(f)=\max(\deg(P),\,\deg(Q))\geq 2,}
  then for a periodic component 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   of the Fatou set, exactly one of the following holds:

  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   contains an attracting periodic point

  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   is parabolic

  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   is a Siegel disc:  a simply connected Fatou component on which f(z) is analytically conjugate to a Euclidean rotation of the unit disc onto itself by an irrational rotation angle.

  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   is a Herman ring: a double connected Fatou component (an annulus) on which f(z) is analytically conjugate to a Euclidean rotation of a round annulus, again by an irrational rotation angle.

Attracting periodic point
The components of the map 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
        z
        −
        (
        
          z
          
            3
          
        
        −
        1
        )
        
          /
        
        3
        
          z
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(z)=z-(z^{3}-1)/3z^{2}}
    contain the attracting points that are the solutions to 
  
    
      
        
          z
          
            3
          
        
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle z^{3}=1}
  . This is because the map is the one to use for finding solutions to the equation 
  
    
      
        
          z
          
            3
          
        
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle z^{3}=1}
   by Newton–Raphson formula. The solutions must naturally be attracting fixed points.

Herman ring
The map

  
    
      
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
        
          e
          
            2
            π
            i
            t
          
        
        
          z
          
            2
          
        
        (
        z
        −
        4
        )
        
          /
        
        (
        1
        −
        4
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(z)=e^{2\pi it}z^{2}(z-4)/(1-4z)}
  and t = 0.6151732... will produce a Herman ring. It is shown by Shishikura that the degree of such map must be at least 3, as in this example.

More than one type of component
If degree d is greater than 2 then there is more than one critical point and then can be more than one type of component

Transcendental case
Baker domain
In case of transcendental functions there is another type of periodic Fatou components, called Baker domain: these are "domains on which the iterates tend to an essential singularity (not possible for polynomials and rational functions)" one example of such a function is:

Wandering domain
Transcendental maps may have wandering domains: these are Fatou components that are not eventually periodic.
