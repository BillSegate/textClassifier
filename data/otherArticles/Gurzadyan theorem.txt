In cosmology, Gurzadyan theorem, proved by Vahe Gurzadyan, states the most general functional form for the force satisfying the condition of identity of the gravity of the sphere and of a point mass located in the sphere's center. This theorem thus refers to the first statement of Isaac Newton’s  shell theorem (the identity mentioned above) but not the second one, namely, the absence of gravitational force inside a shell.The theorem had entered, for example, in physics manual website and its importance for cosmology outlined in several papers   as well as in shell theorem.

The formula and the cosmological constant

Also, this field corresponds to the only field possessing the property of the Newtonian one: the closing of orbits at any negative value of energy, i.e. the coincidence of the period of variation of the value of the radius vector with that of its revolution by

Consequences: cosmological constant as a physical constant
Einstein named the cosmological constant as a universal constant, introducing it to define the static cosmological model.From this theorem the cosmological constant 
  
    
      
        Λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Lambda }
   emerges as additional constant of gravity along with the Newton’s gravitational constant 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  . Then, the cosmological constant is dimension independent and matter-uncoupled and hence can be considered even more universal than Newton’s gravitational constant.For

Observational indications
The dynamics of groups and clusters of galaxies are claimed to fit the theorem, see also.
The possibility of two Hubble flows, a local one, determined by that formula, and a global one, described by Friedmannian cosmological equations was stated in.
