The Mathematical Society of Japan (MSJ, Japanese: 日本数学会) is a learned society for mathematics in Japan.
In 1877, the organization was established as the Tokyo Sugaku Kaisha and was the first academic society in Japan. It was re-organized and re-established in its present form in 1946.
The MSJ has more than 5,000 members. They have the opportunity to participate in programs at MSJ meetings which take place in spring and autumn each year. They also have the opportunity to announce their own research at these meetings.
