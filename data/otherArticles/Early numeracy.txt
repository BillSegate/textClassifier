Early numeracy is a branch of numeracy that aims to enhance numeracy learning for younger learners, particularly those at-risk in the area of mathematics. Usually the mathematical learning begins with simply learning the first digits, 1 through 10. This is done because it acts as an entry way to the expansion of counting. One can keep track of the digits using any of the fingers.
