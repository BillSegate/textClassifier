In quantum field theory, the Dirac adjoint defines the dual operation of a Dirac spinor.  The Dirac adjoint is motivated by the need to form well-behaved, measurable quantities out of Dirac spinors, replacing the usual role of the Hermitian adjoint.
Possibly to avoid confusion with the usual Hermitian adjoint, some textbooks do not provide a name for the Dirac adjoint but simply call it "ψ-bar".

Definition
Let 
  
    
      
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi }
   be a Dirac spinor.  Then its Dirac adjoint is defined as

  
    
      
        
          
            
              ψ
              ¯
            
          
        
        ≡
        
          ψ
          
            †
          
        
        
          γ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {\psi }}\equiv \psi ^{\dagger }\gamma ^{0}}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          ψ
          
            †
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi ^{\dagger }}
   denotes the Hermitian adjoint of the spinor 
  
    
      
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi }
  , and 
  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma ^{0}}
   is the time-like gamma matrix.

Spinors under Lorentz transformations
The Lorentz group of special relativity is not compact, therefore spinor representations of Lorentz transformations are generally not unitary.  That is, if 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   is a projective representation of some Lorentz transformation,

  
    
      
        ψ
        ↦
        λ
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi \mapsto \lambda \psi }
  ,then, in general,

  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            †
          
        
        ≠
        
          λ
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda ^{\dagger }\neq \lambda ^{-1}}
  .The Hermitian adjoint of a spinor transforms according to

  
    
      
        
          ψ
          
            †
          
        
        ↦
        
          ψ
          
            †
          
        
        
          λ
          
            †
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi ^{\dagger }\mapsto \psi ^{\dagger }\lambda ^{\dagger }}
  .Therefore, 
  
    
      
        
          ψ
          
            †
          
        
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi ^{\dagger }\psi }
   is not a Lorentz scalar and 
  
    
      
        
          ψ
          
            †
          
        
        
          γ
          
            μ
          
        
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi ^{\dagger }\gamma ^{\mu }\psi }
   is not even Hermitian.
Dirac adjoints, in contrast, transform according to

  
    
      
        
          
            
              ψ
              ¯
            
          
        
        ↦
        
          
            (
            
              λ
              ψ
            
            )
          
          
            †
          
        
        
          γ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {\psi }}\mapsto \left(\lambda \psi \right)^{\dagger }\gamma ^{0}}
  .Using the identity 
  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            0
          
        
        
          λ
          
            †
          
        
        
          γ
          
            0
          
        
        =
        
          λ
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma ^{0}\lambda ^{\dagger }\gamma ^{0}=\lambda ^{-1}}
  , the transformation reduces to

  
    
      
        
          
            
              ψ
              ¯
            
          
        
        ↦
        
          
            
              ψ
              ¯
            
          
        
        
          λ
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {\psi }}\mapsto {\bar {\psi }}\lambda ^{-1}}
  ,Thus, 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              ψ
              ¯
            
          
        
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {\psi }}\psi }
   transforms as a Lorentz scalar and 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              ψ
              ¯
            
          
        
        
          γ
          
            μ
          
        
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {\psi }}\gamma ^{\mu }\psi }
   as a four-vector.

Usage
Using the Dirac adjoint, the probability four-current J for a spin-1/2 particle field can be written as

  
    
      
        
          J
          
            μ
          
        
        =
        c
        
          
            
              ψ
              ¯
            
          
        
        
          γ
          
            μ
          
        
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle J^{\mu }=c{\bar {\psi }}\gamma ^{\mu }\psi }
  where c is the speed of light and the components of J represent the probability density ρ and the probability 3-current j:

  
    
      
        
          J
        
        =
        (
        c
        ρ
        ,
        
          j
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {J}}=(c\rho ,{\boldsymbol {j}})}
  .Taking μ = 0 and using the relation for gamma matrices

  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              γ
              
                0
              
            
            )
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(\gamma ^{0}\right)^{2}=I}
  ,the probability density becomes

  
    
      
        ρ
        =
        
          ψ
          
            †
          
        
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho =\psi ^{\dagger }\psi }
  .
