In mathematics and physics, especially the study of mechanics and fluid dynamics, the d'Alembert-Euler condition is a requirement that the streaklines of a flow are irrotational.  Let x = x(X,t) be the coordinates of the point x into which X is carried at time t by a (fluid) flow.  Let 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                x
              
              ¨
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                D
                
                  2
                
              
              
                x
              
            
            
              D
              t
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\ddot {\mathbf {x} }}={\frac {D^{2}\mathbf {x} }{Dt}}}
   be the second material derivative of x.  Then the d'Alembert-Euler condition is:

  
    
      
        
          c
          u
          r
          l
        
         
        
          x
        
        =
        
          0
        
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {curl} \ \mathbf {x} =\mathbf {0} .\,}
  The d'Alembert-Euler condition is named for Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Leonhard Euler who independently first described its use in the mid-18th century.  It is not to be confused with the Cauchy–Riemann conditions.
