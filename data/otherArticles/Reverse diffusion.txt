Reverse diffusion refers to a situation where the transport of particles (atoms or molecules) in a medium occurs towards regions of higher concentration gradients, opposite to that observed during diffusion. This phenomenon occurs during phase separation and is described by the Cahnâ€“Hilliard equation. Reverse diffusion also refers to when water is forced from a region of lower concentration to high. It can occur in osmosis.
