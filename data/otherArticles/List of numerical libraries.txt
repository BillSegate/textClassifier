This is a list of numerical libraries, which are libraries used in software development for performing numerical calculations.  It is not a complete listing but is instead a list of numerical libraries with articles on Wikipedia, with few exceptions.
The choice of a typical library depends on a range of requirements such as: desired features (e.g. large dimensional linear algebra, parallel computation, partial differential equations), licensing, readability of API, portability or platform/compiler dependence (e.g. Linux, Windows, Visual C++, GCC), performance, ease-of-use, continued support from developers, standard compliance, specialized optimization in code for specific application scenarios or even the size of the code-base to be installed.

Multi-language
C
C++
Delphi
ALGLIB - an open source numerical analysis library.

.NET Framework languages C#, F#, VB.NET and PowerShell
Fortran
Java
Perl
Perl Data Language gives standard Perl the ability to compactly store and speedily manipulate the large N-dimensional data arrays. It can perform complex and matrix maths, and has interfaces for the GNU Scientific Library, LINPACK, PROJ, and plotting with PGPLOT. There are libraries on CPAN adding support for the linear algebra library LAPACK, the Fourier transform library FFTW, and plotting with gnuplot, and PLplot.

Python
Others
XNUMBERS – multi-precision floating-Point computing and numerical methods for Microsoft Excel.
INTLAB – interval arithmetic library for MATLAB.
