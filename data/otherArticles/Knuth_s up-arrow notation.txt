In mathematics, Knuth's up-arrow notation is a method of notation for very large integers, introduced by Donald Knuth in 1976.In his 1947 paper, R. L. Goodstein introduced the specific sequence of operations that are now called hyperoperations. Goodstein also suggested the Greek names tetration, pentation, etc., for the extended operations beyond exponentiation. The sequence starts with a unary operation (the successor function with n = 0), and continues with the binary operations of addition (n = 1), multiplication (n = 2), exponentiation (n = 3), tetration (n = 4), pentation (n = 5), etc.
Various notations have been used to represent hyperoperations. One such notation is 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            n
          
        
        (
        a
        ,
        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{n}(a,b)}
  .
Knuth's up-arrow notation 
  
    
      
        ↑
      
    
    {\displaystyle \uparrow }
   is another. 
For example:

the single arrow 
  
    
      
        ↑
      
    
    {\displaystyle \uparrow }
   represents exponentiation (iterated multiplication) 
the double arrow 
  
    
      
        ↑↑
      
    
    {\displaystyle \uparrow \uparrow }
   represents tetration (iterated exponentiation) 
the triple arrow 
  
    
      
        ↑↑↑
      
    
    {\displaystyle \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow }
   represents pentation (iterated tetration) The general definition of the up-arrow notation is as follows (for 
  
    
      
        a
        ≥
        0
        ,
        n
        ≥
        1
        ,
        b
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\geq 0,n\geq 1,b\geq 0}
  ):

Here, 
  
    
      
        
          ↑
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \uparrow ^{n}}
   stands for n arrows, so for example

The square brackets are another notation  for hyperoperations.

Introduction
The hyperoperations naturally extend the arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication as follows.
Addition by a natural number is defined as iterated incrementation:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  H
                  
                    1
                  
                
                (
                a
                ,
                b
                )
                =
                a
                +
                b
                =
              
              
                a
                +
                
                  
                    
                      1
                      +
                      1
                      +
                      ⋯
                      +
                      1
                    
                    ⏟
                  
                
              
            
            
              
              
                b
                
                  
                     copies of 
                  
                
                1
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}H_{1}(a,b)=a+b=&a+\underbrace {1+1+\dots +1} \\&b{\mbox{ copies of }}1\end{matrix}}}
  Multiplication by a natural number is defined as iterated addition:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  H
                  
                    2
                  
                
                (
                a
                ,
                b
                )
                =
                a
                ×
                b
                =
              
              
                
                  
                    
                      a
                      +
                      a

                      ⋯
                      +
                      a
                    
                    ⏟
                  
                
              
            
            
              
              
                b
                
                  
                     copies of 
                  
                
                a
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}H_{2}(a,b)=a\times b=&\underbrace {a+a+\dots +a} \\&b{\mbox{ copies of }}a\end{matrix}}}
  For example,

                    ⏟
                  
                
              
              
                =

                3
                
                  
                     copies of

  Exponentiation for a natural power 
  
    
      
        b

Notation
In expressions such as 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{b}}
  , the notation for exponentiation is usually to write the exponent 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   as a superscript to the base number 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  . But many environments — such as programming languages and plain-text e-mail — do not support superscript typesetting. People have adopted the linear notation 
  
    
      
        a
        ↑
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\uparrow b}
   for such environments; the up-arrow suggests 'raising to the power of'. If the character set does not contain an up arrow, the caret (^) is used instead.
The superscript notation 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{b}}
   doesn't lend itself well to generalization, which explains why Knuth chose to work from the inline notation 
  
    
      
        a
        ↑
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\uparrow b}
   instead.

  
    
      
        a
        
          ↑
          
            n
          
        
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\uparrow ^{n}b}
   is a shorter alternative notation for n uparrows. Thus 
  
    
      
        a
        
          ↑
          
            4
          
        
        b
        =
        a
        ↑↑↑↑
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\uparrow ^{4}b=a\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow b}
  .

Writing out up-arrow notation in terms of powers
Attempting to write 
  
    
      
        a
        ↑↑
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\uparrow \uparrow b}
   using the familiar superscript notation gives a power tower.

For example: 
  
    
      
        a
        ↑↑
        4
        =
        a
        ↑
        (
        a
        ↑
        (
        a
        ↑
        a
        )
        )
        =
        
          a
          
            
              a
              
                
                  a
                  
                    a
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\uparrow \uparrow 4=a\uparrow (a\uparrow (a\uparrow a))=a^{a^{a^{a}}}}
  If b is a variable (or is too large), the power tower might be written using dots and a note indicating the height of the tower.

  
    
      
        a
        ↑↑
        b
        =
        
          
            
              
                a
                
                  
                    a
                    
                      
                        .
                        
                          
                            .
                            
                              .
                              
                                a
                              
                            
                          
                        
                      
                    
                  
                
              
              ⏟
            
          
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\uparrow \uparrow b=\underbrace {a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}} _{b}}
  Continuing with this notation, 
  
    
      
        a
        ↑↑↑
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow b}
   could be written with a stack of such power towers, each describing the size of the one above it.

   for tetration allows us to make these diagrams slightly simpler while still employing a geometric representation (we could call these tetration towers).

Generalizations
Some numbers are so large that multiple arrows of Knuth's up-arrow notation become too cumbersome; then an n-arrow operator

    {\displaystyle \uparrow ^{n}}
   is useful (and also for descriptions with a variable number of arrows), or equivalently, hyper operators.
Some numbers are so large that even that notation is not sufficient. The Conway chained arrow notation can then be used: a chain of three elements is equivalent with the other notations, but a chain of four or more is even more powerful.

        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\omega ^{2}}(x)}
   is comparable to arbitrarily-long Conway chained arrow notation.
These functions are all computable. Even faster computable functions, such as the Goodstein sequence and the TREE sequence require the usage of large ordinals, may occur in certain combinatorical and proof-theoretic contexts. There exists functions which grow uncomputably fast, such as the Busy Beaver, whose very nature will be completely out of reach from any up-arrow, or even any ordinal-based analysis.

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a\uparrow ^{1}b=a\uparrow b=a^{b})}
   as the base case, and tetration 
  
    
      
        (
        a

        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a\uparrow ^{2}b=a\uparrow \uparrow b)}
   as repeated exponentiation.  This is equivalent to the hyperoperation sequence except it omits the three more basic operations of succession, addition and multiplication.
One can alternatively choose multiplication 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        
          ↑

        =
        a
        ×
        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a\uparrow ^{0}b=a\times b)}
   as the base case and iterate from there. Then exponentiation becomes repeated multiplication. The formal definition would be

Note, however, that Knuth did not define the "nil-arrow" (
  
    
      
        
          ↑
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \uparrow ^{0}}
  ). One could extend the notation to negative indices (n ≥ -2) in such a way as to agree with the entire hyperoperation sequence, except for the lag in the indexing:

  
    
      
        
          H
          
            n
          
        
        (
        a
        ,
        b
        )
        =
        a
        [
        n
        ]
        b
        =
        a
        
          ↑
          
            n
            −
            2
          
        
        b
        
           for 
        
        n
        ≥
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{n}(a,b)=a[n]b=a\uparrow ^{n-2}b{\text{ for }}n\geq 0.}
  The up-arrow operation is a right-associative operation, that is, 
  
    
      
        a
        ↑
        b
        ↑
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\uparrow b\uparrow c}
   is understood to be 
  
    
      
        a
        ↑
        (
        b
        ↑
        c
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\uparrow (b\uparrow c)}
  , instead of 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        ↑
        b
        )
        ↑
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a\uparrow b)\uparrow c}
  . If ambiguity is not an issue parentheses are sometimes dropped.

   can be restated in terms of an infinite table. We place the numbers

            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2^{b}}
   in the top row, and fill the left column with values 2. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken.

The table is the same as that of the Ackermann function, except for a shift in 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   and

  , and an addition of 3 to all values.

    {\displaystyle 3^{b}}
   in the top row, and fill the left column with values 3. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken.

Computing 4↑n b
We place the numbers 
  
    
      
        
          4
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 4^{b}}
   in the top row, and fill the left column with values 4. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken.

Computing 10↑n b
We place the numbers 
  
    
      
        
          10
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 10^{b}}
   in the top row, and fill the left column with values 10. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken.

For 2 ≤ b ≤ 9 the numerical order of the numbers

        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle 10\uparrow ^{n}b}
   is the lexicographical order with n as the most significant number, so for the numbers of these 8 columns the numerical order is simply line-by-line. The same applies for the numbers in the 97 columns with 3 ≤ b ≤ 99, and if we start from n = 1 even for 3 ≤ b ≤ 9,999,999,999.
