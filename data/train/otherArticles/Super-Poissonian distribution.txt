In mathematics, a super-Poissonian distribution is a probability distribution that has a larger variance than a Poisson distribution with the same mean. Conversely, a sub-Poissonian distribution has a smaller variance.
An example of super-Poissonian distribution is negative binomial distribution.The Poisson distribution is a result of a process where the time (or an equivalent measure) between events has an exponential distribution, representing a memoryless process.

Mathematical definition
In probability theory it is common to say a distribution, D, is a sub-distribution of another distribution E if D 's moment-generating function, is bounded by E 's up to a constant.
In other words

  
    
      
        
          E
          
            X
            ∼
            D
          
        
        [
        exp
        ⁡
        (
        t
        X
        )
        ]
        ≤
        
          E
          
            X
            ∼
            E
          
        
        [
        exp
        ⁡
        (
        C
        t
        X
        )
        ]
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle E_{X\sim D}[\exp(tX)]\leq E_{X\sim E}[\exp(CtX)].}
  for some C > 0.
This implies that if 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{1}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{2}}
   are both from a sub-E distribution, then so is 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            1
          
        
        +
        
          X
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{1}+X_{2}}
  .
A distribution is strictly sub- if C ≤ 1.
From this definition a distribution, D, is sub-Poissonian if

  
    
      
        
          E
          
            X
            ∼
            D
          
        
        [
        exp
        ⁡
        (
        t
        X
        )
        ]
        ≤
        
          E
          
            X
            ∼
            
              Poisson
            
            (
            λ
            )
          
        
        [
        exp
        ⁡
        (
        t
        X
        )
        ]
        =
        exp
        ⁡
        (
        λ
        (
        
          e
          
            t
          
        
        −
        1
        )
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle E_{X\sim D}[\exp(tX)]\leq E_{X\sim {\text{Poisson}}(\lambda )}[\exp(tX)]=\exp(\lambda (e^{t}-1)),}
  for all t > 0.An example of a sub-Poissonian distribution is the Bernoulli distribution, since

  
    
      
        E
        [
        exp
        ⁡
        (
        t
        X
        )
        ]
        =
        (
        1
        −
        p
        )
        +
        p
        
          e
          
            t
          
        
        ≤
        exp
        ⁡
        (
        p
        (
        
          e
          
            t
          
        
        −
        1
        )
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle E[\exp(tX)]=(1-p)+pe^{t}\leq \exp(p(e^{t}-1)).}
  Because sub-Poissonianism is preserved by sums, we get that the binomial distribution is also sub-Poissonian.
