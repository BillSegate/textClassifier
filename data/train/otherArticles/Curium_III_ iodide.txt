Curium(III) iodide is the chemical compound with the formula CmI3. Since all isotopes of curium are only artificially produced, the compound has no natural occurrence.

Synthesis
Elemental curium and iodine can be reacted to synthesize curium(III) iodide.
2Cm + 3I2  →  2CmI3Also by the reaction of curium(III) chloride with ammonium iodide:
CmCl3 + 3NH4I  →  CmI3 + 3NH4Cl

Physical properties
Curium(III) iodide is a colorless ionic compound consisting of Cm3+ and I− ions. It forms white crystals the hexagonal crystal system in the space group R3 (space group no. 148) with the lattice parameters a = 744 pm and c = 2040 pm with six units per unit cell. Its crystal structure is isotypic with that of bismuth(III) iodide.
