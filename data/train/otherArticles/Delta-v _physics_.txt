In general physics, delta-v is a change in velocity. The Greek uppercase letter Δ (delta) is the standard mathematical symbol to represent change in some quantity.
Depending on the situation, delta-v can be either a spatial vector (Δv) or scalar (Δv). In either case it is equal to the acceleration (vector or scalar) integrated over time:

Vector version: 
Scalar version: If acceleration is constant, the change in velocity can thus be expressed as:

  
    
      
        Δ
        
          v
        
        =
        
          
            v
          
          
            1
          
        
        −
        
          
            v
          
          
            0
          
        
        =
        
          a
        
        ×
        Δ
        t
        =
        
          a
        
        ×
        (
        
          t
          
            1
          
        
        −
        
          t
          
            0
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {v} _{1}-\mathbf {v} _{0}=\mathbf {a} \times \Delta t=\mathbf {a} \times (t_{1}-t_{0})}
  
where:

v0 or v0 is initial velocity (at time t0),
v1 or v1 is subsequent velocity (at time t1).Change in velocity is useful in many cases, such as determining the change in momentum (impulse), where: 
  
    
      
        Δ
        
          p
        
        =
        m
        Δ
        
          v
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta \mathbf {p} =m\Delta \mathbf {v} }
  , where 
  
    
      
        
          p
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} }
   is momentum and m is mass.
