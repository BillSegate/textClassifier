List of United States Naval reactors is a comprehensive list of all naval reactors designed, built, or used by the United States Navy.

Reactor designations
Each nuclear reactor design is given a three-character designation consisting of a letter representing the type of ship the reactor is intended for, a consecutive generation number, and a letter indicating the reactor's designer.
Ship types:

"A" – aircraft carrier
"C" – cruiser
"D" – destroyer
"S" – submarineContracted designers:

"B" – Bechtel
"C" – Combustion Engineering
"G" – General Electric
"W" – Westinghouse
