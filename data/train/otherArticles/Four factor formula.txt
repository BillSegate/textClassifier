The four-factor formula, also known as Fermi's four factor formula is used in nuclear engineering to determine the multiplication of a nuclear chain reaction in an infinite medium.

The symbols are defined as:

Multiplication
The multiplication factor, k, is defined as (see Nuclear chain reaction): 

  
    
      
        k
        =
        
          
            
              neutron population following nth generation
            
            
              neutron population during nth generation
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle k={\frac {\mbox{neutron population following nth generation}}{\mbox{neutron population during nth generation}}}}
  If k is greater than 1, the chain reaction is supercritical, and the neutron population will grow exponentially.
If k is less than 1, the chain reaction is subcritical, and the neutron population will exponentially decay.
If k = 1, the chain reaction is critical and the neutron population will remain constant.In an infinite medium, neutrons cannot leak out of the system and the multiplication factor becomes the infinite multiplication factor, 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        
          k
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=k_{\infty }}
  , which is approximated by the four-factor formula.
