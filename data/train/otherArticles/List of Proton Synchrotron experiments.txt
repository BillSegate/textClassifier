This is a list of past and current experiments at the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) facility since its commissioning in 1959. The PS was CERN's first synchrotron and the world's highest energy particle accelerator at the time. It served as the flagship of CERN until the 1980s when its main role became to provide injection beams to other machines such as the Super Proton Synchrotron.
The information is gathered from the INSPIRE-HEP database.
