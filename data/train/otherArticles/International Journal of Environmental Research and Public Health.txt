Criticism and controversy
In February 2023, Clarivate delisted the journal in its main citation indexes (Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index), citing "publications that were deemed outside the scope of the journal". A delisted journal does not receive rank metrics such as a Clarivate journal impact factor.In April 2023, the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health published a paper which criticized guidelines set by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, claiming that radiation from cell phones presents a "health threat is scientifically documented at many levels and acknowledged by industries". The paper claimed that "there are no adequate health effects studies on the projected evolution of wireless systems such as 5G", and that "the effects of 1G to 4G systems have been ignored". The paper questioned whether health guidelines set out by the World Health Organization were independent of the telecommunications industry.
