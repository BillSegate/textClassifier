Photosymbiosis is a type of symbiosis where one of the organisms is capable of photosynthesis.

Examples
Examples of photosymbiotic relationships include those in lichens, plankton, and many marine organisms including coral, giant clams, and jellyfish.

Significance
Photosymbiosis is important in the development, maintenance, and evolution of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, for example through supporting soil formation, soil stabilization, and coral reef growth and maintenance.Photosymbiotic relationships where microalgae live within a heterotrophic host organism, is believed to have led to eukaryotes acquiring photosynthesis and the evolution of plants.
