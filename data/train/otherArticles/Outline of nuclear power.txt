The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to nuclear power:
Nuclear power – the use of sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and electricity. Nuclear power plants provide about 6% of the world's energy and 13–14% of the world's electricity, with the U.S., France, and Japan together accounting for about 50% of nuclear generated electricity.

What type of thing is nuclear power?
Nuclear power can be described as all of the following:

Nuclear technology (outline) – technology that involves the reactions of atomic nuclei. Among the notable nuclear technologies are nuclear power, nuclear medicine, and nuclear weapons. It has found applications from smoke detectors to nuclear reactors, and from gun sights to nuclear weapons.
Electricity generation – the process of generating electric energy from other forms of energy. The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820s and early 1830s by the British scientist Michael Faraday.  His basic method is still used today: electricity is generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or disc of copper between the poles of a magnet.
