Radiation Effects in Insulators (REI) is a long-running international conference series
dedicated to basic and applied scientific research relating to radiation effects in insulators and non-metallic materials. It is held every second year in locations around the world.
The REI conference has a long history. Since the first conference was held in 1981, REI has been the international forum to present and discuss the latest achievements in the field of insulating materials modification through different kind of radiation (ions, electrons, neutrons, etc). The conference regularly attracts about 200 attendees.

Topics covered
The REI conference covers a wide range of topics including the following.

Atomistic and Collective Processes of Radiation Effects
Fundamental knowledge on atomistic and electronic defect production and stability
Irradiation-induced microstructural evolution and material modifications
Fundamentals, theory and computer simulations
Advances in defect and material characterization
Radiation response of nanomaterials
Swift heavy ion irradiations
Neutron irradiations
Laser-solid interactions
Electron-solid interactions

Irradiated Materials
Simple and complex oxides
