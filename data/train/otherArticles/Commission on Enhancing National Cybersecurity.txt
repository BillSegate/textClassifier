The President's Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity is a Presidential Commission formed on April 13, 2016, to develop a plan for protecting cyberspace, and America's economic reliance on it. The commission released its final report in December 2016.  The report made recommendations regarding the intertwining roles of the military, government administration and the private sector in providing cyber security.  Chairman Donilon said of the report that its coverage "is unusual in the breadth of issues" with which it deals.

Recommendations
The report made sixteen major recommendations with fifty-three specific action items broadly grouped under six areas:
Protecting the information and digital infrastructure
Investing in the secure growth of information and digital infrastructure
Consumer information access
Building the cybersecurity workforce
Building a secure governmental cybersecurity framework
Keeping interconnectivity open, fair, competitive, and secureThe Commission found that strong authentication systems were mandatory for adequate cybersecurity, not just for the government, but for all commercial systems, and private individuals. The commission also stressed remote identity proofing and security for the Internet of things (IoT). Finding that technicians who know cybersecurity and can protect systems are few and in short supply, the commission recommended nationally supported training programs to produce an adequate workforce, as well as increasing the level of expertise in the existing workforce. The Commission highlighted the importance of partnerships between government and the private sector as a powerful tool for encouraging the technology, policies and practices we need to secure and grow the digital economy. (page 2)Some criticised the commission's work as lacking an understanding of cybersecurity and not being cognizant of "cyber reality" and the cost of some of the action items, but others found the report constructive and meaningful.
