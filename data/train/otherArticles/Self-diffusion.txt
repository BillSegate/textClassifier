According to IUPAC definition, self-diffusion coefficient is the diffusion coefficient 
  
    
      
        
          D
          
            i
          
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle D_{i}^{*}}
   of species 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   when the chemical potential gradient equals zero. It is linked to the diffusion coefficient 
  
    
      
        
          D
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle D_{i}}
   by the equation:

  
    
      
        
          D
          
            i
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        =
        
          D
          
            i
          
        
        
          
            
              ∂
              ln
              ⁡
              
                c
                
                  i
                
              
            
            
              ∂
              ln
              ⁡
              
                a
                
                  i
                
              
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle D_{i}^{*}=D_{i}{\frac {\partial \ln c_{i}}{\partial \ln a_{i}}}.}
  
Here, 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{i}}
   is the activity of the species 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   in the solution and 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{i}}
   is the concentration of 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
  . This term is commonly assumed to be equal to the tracer diffusion determined by watching the movement of an isotope in the material of interest.
