This is a List of Australian inquiries and reports relating to uranium mining issues.

Background
For several decades uranium mining has been a major part of the Australian political landscape, with opposition groups citing the wide-ranging environmental impacts, indigenous land access and nuclear proliferation as reasons for ceasing or restricting the industry.  The debate has resulted in limitations on mining and export activities, with Federal and State governments occasionally flip-flopping on public policy.  In the meantime, mining companies have pursued exploration activities, and in some instances stockpiled mined ore.
