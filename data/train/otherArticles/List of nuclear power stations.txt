The following page lists operating nuclear power stations. The list is based on figures from PRIS (Power Reactor Information System) maintained by International Atomic Energy Agency.

In service
This table lists all currently operational power stations. Some of these may have reactors under construction, but only current net capacity is listed. Capacity of permanently shut-down reactors is not included, but capacity of long-term shut-down reactors (today mainly in Japan) is included.

Under construction
This table lists stations under construction stations without any reactor in service. Planned connection column indicates the connection of the first reactor, not thus whole capacity.

Permanently shut down
This table lists stations that are permanently shut down. Listed on 1985, 2005-2022 ongoing.
