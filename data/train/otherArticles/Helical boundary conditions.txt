In mathematics, helical boundary conditions are a variation on periodic boundary conditions. Helical boundary conditions provide a method for determining the index of a lattice site's neighbours when each lattice site is indexed by just a single coordinate. On a lattice of dimension d where the lattice sites are numbered from 1 to N and L is the width (i.e. number of elements per row) of the lattice in all but the last dimension, the neighbors of site i are:

  
    
      
        (
        i
        ±
        1
        )
        
        mod
        
        
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle (i\pm 1)\mod N}
  

  
    
      
        (
        i
        ±
        L
        )
        
        mod
        
        
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle (i\pm L)\mod N}
  

  
    
      
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ldots }
  

  
    
      
        (
        i
        ±
        
          L
          
            d
            −
            1
          
        
        )
        
        mod
        
        
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle (i\pm L^{d-1})\mod N}
  where the modulo operator is used. It is not necessary that N = Ld. Helical boundary conditions make it possible to use only one coordinate to describe arbitrary-dimensional lattices.
