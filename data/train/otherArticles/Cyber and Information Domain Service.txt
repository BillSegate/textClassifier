History
In November 2015, the German Ministry of Defense activated a Staff Group within the ministry tasked with developing plans for a reorganization of the Cyber, IT, military intelligence, geo-information, and operative communication units of the Bundeswehr.
On 26 April 2016, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen  presented the plans for the new military branch to the public and on 5 October 2016 the command's staff became operational as a department within the ministry of defense. On 1 April 2017, the Cyber and Information Domain Service was activated as the 6th branch of the Bundeswehr. The Cyber and Information Domain Service Headquarters will take command of all existing Cyber, IT, military intelligence, geoinformation, and operative communication units. The Command is planned to be fully operational by 2021.
