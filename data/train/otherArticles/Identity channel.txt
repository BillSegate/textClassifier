In quantum information theory, the identity channel is a noise-free quantum channel. That is, the channel outputs exactly what was put in.The identity channel is commonly denoted as 
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          
            i
            d
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {id}}}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          I
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {I} }
  .
