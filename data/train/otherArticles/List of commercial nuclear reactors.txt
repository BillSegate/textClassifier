This is a list of all the commercial nuclear reactors in the world, sorted by country, with operational status. The list only includes civilian nuclear power reactors used to generate electricity for a power grid. All commercial nuclear reactors use nuclear fission. As of September 2023, there are 412 operable power reactors in the world, with a combined electrical capacity of 368.6 GW. Additionally, there are 60 reactors under construction and 110 reactors planned, with a combined capacity of 67 GW and 107 GW, respectively, while 321 more reactors are proposed. For non-power reactors, see List of nuclear research reactors. For fuel plants see List of Nuclear Reprocessing Plants. Where not otherwise specified, all information is sourced from the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).In the following tables, the capacity (expressed in megawatt, MW) refers to the net capacity, or the maximum electricity output under reference ambient conditions, after deducting the losses within the system including the energy transformers.
