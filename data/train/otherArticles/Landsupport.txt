Landsupport (spelling: LANDSUPPORT) is a pilot consulting project funded by the European Union for land use for the near-natural modeling of different types and methods of land use while at the same time protecting the environment.

Project goal
In the long term, sustainable use of the soil must be guaranteed in order to meet the needs of the world's population. The project brings together numerous universities, research institutions, companies and stakeholders with the aim of creating a web-based, free system to support practical agriculture and land users in making decisions about sustainable land use, environmental protection and agricultural use.
With the active participation of various and numerous stakeholders in and outside Europe, the consortium also aims at legislation at European level, based on scientific data that is processed and modeled in the system.
In the research framework program Horizon 2020, the project is organized under the direction of Fabio Terribile at the University of Naples Federico II.
