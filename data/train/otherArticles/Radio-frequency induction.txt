For the common use of RF induction process of heating a metal object by electromagnetic induction, see induction heatingRadio-frequency induction (RF induction) is the use of a radio frequency magnetic field to transfer energy by means of electromagnetic induction in the near field. A radio-frequency alternating current is passed through a coil of wire that acts as the transmitter, and a second coil or conducting object, magnetically coupled to the first coil, acts as the receiver.
