Critical Masses: Opposition to Nuclear Power in California, 1958–1978 is the first detailed history of the  anti-nuclear movement in the United States, written by Thomas Wellock. It is also the first state-level research on the subject with a focus on California. Reviewer Paula Garb has said:

The book is rich with vivid verbal pictures and the passionate voices of participants on all sides of the controversy around the peaceful atom. It is based on interviews, documents from state and federal archives, and activist papers. Wellock brings to this project the expertise of a former engineer for civilian and navy nuclear reactors, a thorough archivist, and a sensitive interviewer.

The central argument of the book is that the anti-nuclear movement played a key part in the Californian nuclear power demise up to 1978.
