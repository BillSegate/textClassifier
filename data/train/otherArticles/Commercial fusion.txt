First fusion electricity to the grid
For decades researchers have famously said that fusion power is always 30, or even 50, years away. The advent of commercial fusion has changed that, and now fusion power is typically predicted to be around 10 years away, with most companies predicting that the first fusion plant will deliver electricity to the grid before 2035. Although the majority of the companies have only existed for a few years, some have already failed to deliver on their predictions. General Fusion first predicted that it would deliver electricity to the grid by 2009.
