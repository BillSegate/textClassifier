Content
In this document, the Pope expresses hope that societies around the world will change their lifestyles and intensify grassroots activities aimed at reducing the negative human impact on the natural environment, to prevent even more tragic damage to the Earth. The dramatic environmental degradation strongly affects not only the indigenous peoples, the poor, and endangered species, but also the future of all young people. He also calls on politicians and the rich to work for the common good, and not for their own profit and particular interests. Finally (in paragraph 73) the Pope emphasises that "when human beings claim to take God’s place, they become their own worst enemies".As in Laudato Si', the Pope makes use of several quotations from assemblies of bishops held around the world.: Paragraph 3
