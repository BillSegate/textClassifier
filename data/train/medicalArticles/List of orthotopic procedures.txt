Orthotopic liver transplantation, in which the previous liver is removed and the transplant is placed at that location in the body
Orthotopic heart transplantation
Orthotopic kidney transplantation.When organs are transplanted to a different anatomical location the procedure is said to be heterotopic (e.g. heterotopic heart transplantation).
