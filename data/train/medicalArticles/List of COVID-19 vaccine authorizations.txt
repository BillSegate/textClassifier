National regulatory authorities have granted full or emergency use authorizations for 40 COVID-19 vaccines.
Ten vaccines have been approved for emergency or full use by at least one stringent regulatory authority recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO): Pfizer–BioNTech, Oxford–AstraZeneca, Sinopharm BIBP, Moderna, Janssen, CoronaVac, Covaxin, Novavax, Convidecia, and Sanofi–GSK. Seven others are under assessment by the WHO: Sputnik V, Sinopharm WIBP, Abdala, Zifivax, Corbevax, COVIran Barekat, and SCB-2019.Of the 40 vaccines, 16 have a full or emergency authorization in only one country, 12 in ten or fewer countries, and 12 in more than ten countries.
Note that in some countries, vaccines may be authorized solely for travel purposes. They may not be approved for the general population. For example, the CoronaVac, Covishield, BBIBP-CorV and Covaxin vaccines are not part of Australia's national vaccination program; however, they are recognized for the purpose of travel to Australia.

Overview maps
Oxford–AstraZeneca
The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, sold under the brand names Vaxzevria and Covishield, is a viral vector vaccine produced by the British University of Oxford, British-Swedish company AstraZeneca, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Finland, Denmark, and Norway suspended the use of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine due to a small number of reports of a rare blood clot disorder. Slovakia suspended its use after the death of a predisposed recipient. South Africa suspended its use because a small trial found only minimal protection against mild to moderate disease from the locally predominant Beta variant. Japan approved the vaccine for emergency use in May 2021, but did not plan to use them immediately because of rare cases of a blood clotting disorder reported overseas. Later, Japan started to use the vaccine for people aged 40 or over to mitigate the surge of the Delta variant in August. Finland ceased use of the vaccine as the last batch expired on 30 November 2021. Until then it was only offered for those aged 65 or more due to extremely rare coagulation disorders among younger recipients of the vaccine. After this Finland will not procure more of the vaccine. The AstraZeneca vaccine is the most widely accepted internationally, and the most popular in terms of total inoculated worldwide, over 1.3 billion. The AstraZeneca vaccine is administered in more countries than any other vaccine.

Janssen
The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is a viral vector vaccine produced by Janssen Pharmaceutica (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. It is also known as Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine and as COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. Three countries, Denmark, Finland, and Norway, discontinued the use of the Janssen vaccine in favor of other available vaccines due to a possible link between the vaccine and a rare blood clot disorder. The use of the Janssen adenovirus vector vaccine began in Finland in October 2021. It is only offered for those aged 65 and over because of a very rare risk of thrombosis in younger age groups.  The United States began use of the Janssen vaccine in March 2021, but discouraged use in favor of other available vaccines in December 2021 due to the risk of a rare clotting disorder. The Janssen vaccine became unavailable in the United States in May 2023 after all existing doses expired.
