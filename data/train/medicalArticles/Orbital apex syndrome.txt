Orbital apex syndrome, is a collection of cranial nerve deficits associated with a mass lesion near the apex of the orbit of the eye. This syndrome is a separate entity from Rochon–Duvigneaud syndrome, which occurs due to a lesion immediately anterior to the orbital apex. Most commonly optic nerve is involved.

Presentation
The most common finding is oculomotor nerve dysfunction leading to ophthalmoplegia. This is often accompanied by ophthalmic nerve dysfunction, leading to hypoesthesia of the upper face. The optic nerve may eventually be involved, with resulting visual loss.

Causes
Jacod Syndrome is commonly associated with a tumor of the middle cranial fossa (near the apex of the orbit); but it can have several other causes.

Neoplastic causes
Head and neck cancer
Neural tumors
Hematological cancer

Inflammatory causes
Sarcoidosis
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Giant cell arteritis
Thyroid disease

Traumatic causes
Iatrogenic (following surgery)
Orbital apex fracture
Penetrating injury

Vascular causes
Carotid aneurysm

Diagnosis
Diagnostic methods vary, and are based on specific possible etiologies; however, an X-ray computed tomography scan of the face (or magnetic resonance imaging, or both) may be helpful.
