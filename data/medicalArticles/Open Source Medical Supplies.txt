Open Source Medical Supplies is a not for profit organization that collates and shares open source designs to make personal protective equipment and other medical supplies needed in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Organization
Open Source Medical Supplies founded by Jaâ€™dan Johnson and Gui Cavalcanti in March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic was escalating. Initial activities were coordinated through a Facebook group which grew to 52,000 members. A team of 130 people coordinate and filter the information in the group.

Activities
Open Source Medical Supplies provides a library of 195 DIY instructions on how to fabricate healthcare items including face masks. All designs are vetted by a team of thirty healthcare professionals. Open Source Medical Supplies has shipped over 15 million items of medical supplies.
