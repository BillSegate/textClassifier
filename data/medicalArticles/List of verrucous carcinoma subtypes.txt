Verrucous carcinoma is a type of squamous cell carcinoma that may be associated with HPV infection (may be subtypes 16 or 18, but types 6 and 11 have also been reported, as have HPV negative variants).  Several subtypes of verrucous carcinoma have been described.  Treatment of verrucous carcinoma with radiation therapy should be avoided due to the risk of anaplastic transformation.
