History
When the first cases of human mpox were identified in the DRC, Liberia and Sierre Leone in 1970, there were no detected cases in Nigeria, and surveillance of several non-human primates in Nigeria did not identify any monkeypox virus. Two cases of mpox were first identified in Nigeria in 1971. The first case was a four-year-old female, whose rash began on 9 April.
