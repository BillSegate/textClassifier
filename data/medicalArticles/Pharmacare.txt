Pharmacare is a Canadian proposal for a publicly-funded insurance program for medications, similar to Medicare for health insurance. Limited pharmacare programs exist in the provinces of Ontario, Manitoba, and British Columbia. Multiple organizers and commenters have advocated a pan-Canadian pharmacare program to complement the existing health system, but the precise model for implementation is unclear.In 2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to implement pharmacare if re-elected. As of November 2020, this pledge is unfulfilled.
