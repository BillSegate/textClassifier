Francesco Racanelli (1904–1978) was an Italian doctor, pranotherapist and writer, and the originator of an unconventional therapy that he called in Italian: medicina bioradiante or "bio-radiant medicine".

Biography
Francesco Racanelli was born in 1904 in Sannicandro di Bari, Puglia, Italy. He believed that he possessed a gift which, much later in his life, he called "bio-radiant energy", and that there was a "vital fluid" which "emanated" from "particularly gifted people". He began to practice on people. As a result, he was prosecuted for the illegal practice of medicine. To avoid further legal problems, he studied medicine and qualified as a doctor. He worked as a healer and lecturer in Florence. He treated wounded people in Florence during the Liberation of Italy.Francesco Racanelli died in Orbetello, in 1978.
