Proposals for experiments are made at CERN and have to go through the correct channels in order to be approved. One of the last steps in the process is to submit the proposal to an appropriate CERN Scientific Committee. The committees will discuss the proposal and then pass on their recommendations to the Research Board (previously the Nuclear Physics Research Committee) for the final decision. Proposals approved become part of the CERN experimental programme.In 1960, John Adams, the Director General, created three committees to manage experiments for each bubble chamber experimental technique used at CERN. These replaced the previous Advisory and Bubble Chamber committees. At the end of the bubble chamber period, the system was again changed and based on machine, rather than experimental technique. The committees were changed and merged in order to accommodate to this. Since then, the committees have changed based on the creation and decommissioning of facilities and accelerators.
