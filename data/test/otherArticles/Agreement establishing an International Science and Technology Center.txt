History
The ISTC was established in 1992. Its headquarters were originally in Moscow and it governed further scientific centers in the former Soviet Union in order to redirect the expertise of CBRN scientists to civil research fields.
In July 2015, the ISTC moved to Astanaâ€™s Nazarbayev University after The Russian Federation demanded more secrecy and withdrew from the activity.
