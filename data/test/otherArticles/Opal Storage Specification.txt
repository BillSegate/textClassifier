The Opal Storage Specification is a set of specifications for features of data storage devices (such as hard disk drives and solid state drives) that enhance their security.  For example, it defines a way of encrypting the stored data so that an unauthorized person who gains possession of the device cannot see the data.  That is, it is a specification for self-encrypting drives (SED).
The specification is published by the Trusted Computing Group Storage Workgroup.

Overview
The Opal SSC (Security Subsystem Class) is an implementation profile for Storage Devices built to:

Protect the confidentiality of stored user data against unauthorized access once it leaves the owner's control (involving a power cycle and subsequent deauthentication).
Enable interoperability between multiple SD vendors.

Functions
The Opal SSC encompasses these functions:

Security provider support
Interface communication protocol
Cryptographic features
Authentication
Table management
Access control and personalization
Issuance
SSC discovery

Features
Security Protocol 1 support
Security Protocol 2 support
Communications
Protocol stack reset commands

Security
Radboud University researchers indicated in November 2018 that some hardware-encrypted SSDs, including some Opal implementations, had security vulnerabilities.
