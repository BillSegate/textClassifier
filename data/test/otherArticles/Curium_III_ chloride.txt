Curium(III) chloride is the chemical compound with the formula CmCl3.

Structure
Curium(III) chloride has a 9 coordinate tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry.

Synthesis
A reaction of hydrogen chloride gas with curium dioxide, curium(III) oxide, or curium(III) oxychloride at a temperature of 400-600 °C:CmOCl + 2HCl  →  CmCl3 + H2ODissolution of metallic curium in dilute hydrochloric acid:2Cm + 6HCl  →  2CmCl3 + 3H2This method has a number of disadvantages associated with the ongoing processes of hydrolysis and hydration of the resulting compound in an aqueous solution. Thus, it is problematic to obtain a pure product using this reaction.

Preparation
Curium(III) chloride can be prepared by the reaction of curium nitride with cadmium chloride.
