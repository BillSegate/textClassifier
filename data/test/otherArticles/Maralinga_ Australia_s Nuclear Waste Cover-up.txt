Maralinga: Australia's Nuclear Waste Cover-up  is a book by Alan Parkinson about the clean-up of the British atomic bomb test site at Maralinga in South Australia, published in 2007.

Overview
Parkinson, a nuclear engineer and former Government Representative to oversee the Maralinga Rehabilitation Project, explains that the clean-up of Maralinga in the late 1990s was compromised by cost-cutting and simply involved dumping hazardous radioactive debris in shallow holes in the ground. Parkinson states that "What was done at Maralinga was a cheap and nasty solution that wouldn't be adopted on white-fellas land."
