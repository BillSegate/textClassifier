Uranyl carbonate refers to the inorganic compound with the formula UO2CO3. Also known by its mineral name rutherfordine, this material consists of uranyl (UO22+) and carbonate (CO32-). Like most uranyl salts, the compound is a polymeric, each uranium(VI) center being bonded to eight O atoms.  Hydrolysis products of rutherfordine are also found in both the mineral and organic fractions of coal and its fly ash and is the main component of uranium in mine tailing seepage water.

Uranyl carbonates as a class of materials
Many uranyl carbonates exist, rutherfordine being the simplest stoichiometry. Most uranyl carbonates additional components including water and diverse anions and cations.A common method for concentrating uranium from a solution uses solutions of uranyl carbonates, which are passed through a resin bed where the complex ions are transferred to the resin by ion exchange with a negative ion like chloride. After build-up of the uranium complex on the resin, the uranium is eluted with a salt solution and the uranium is precipitated in another process.
