Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment (CORE) is a non-political, non-profit organisation, located in Barrow-in-Furness, which since 1980 has campaigned against all aspects of the operation of Sellafield, formerly Windscale, and the site of the 1957 reactor fire. Issues of current interest are radioactive air and sea discharges, resultant environmental contamination, and the health detriment to local communities and wildlife. As well as preparing compensation cases for Sellafield workers, CORE has taken part in many direct action campaigns which have resulted in a string of injunctions.
