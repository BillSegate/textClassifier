The International Luxembourg Forum on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe (also The Luxembourg Forum) — is an international non-governmental organisation uniting leading world-renowned experts on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, materials and delivery vehicles.
The Forum was established pursuant to a decision passed by the International Conference on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe held in Luxembourg on May 24–25, 2007. The Conference discussed new challenges and threats to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the underlying nuclear non-proliferation regime, the threat of nuclear terrorism, developments in controlling nuclear technologies, enhancement of IAEA safeguards and the current situation in problematic states and regions (the Middle East, East and South Asia).
To achieve a practical strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, the Conference participants prepared a final document and called it the Luxembourg Conference Declaration. The Declaration reflects the opinion of 57 independent experts on global security, arms control and disarmament from 14 countries, and included a roadmap to resolution of the complex nuclear situation.
The most important result of the conference was the establishment of a permanent Luxembourg Forum, which originally included the 43 parties to the Declaration. The results of the Conference and the official Declaration were presented on December 18, 2007 in Moscow.The Conference was one of the most relevant events dealing exclusively with nuclear non-proliferation issues.

Cooperation between Luxembourg Forum and Vatican
In 2019, participants of the International Luxembourg Forum’s conference in Rome, experts in nuclear security, nuclear arms reduction, control and non-proliferation from the United States, Russia, France, Sweden, Canada, Australia and other countries were received by the Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, as part of the dialogue and joint initiatives of the Luxembourg Forum and the Holy See.
Heads of five major international organizations dealing with nuclear arms control issues (the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, Global Zero, the Russian International Affairs Council, and James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (United States)) attended the meeting.
Cardinal Pietro Parolin confirmed the Holy See's concerns about the issues of nuclear arms control, underscored the need of their maximum limitation and minimizing the risk of their use, and affirmed the Holy See’s commitment to strengthen global security and develop a multilateral dialogue to prevent the threat of nuclear catastrophe.

Forum Priorities
The Luxembourg Forum focuses on two priorities:
— Counteracting growing threats to the nuclear non-proliferation regime and erosion of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), including the escalating danger of nuclear terrorism and attempts by rogue states to gain access to nuclear materials and technologies. At present, close attention is paid to nuclear weapons non-proliferation in the Middle East region and on the Korean Peninsula;
— Promoting international peace and security through new approaches and by presenting recommendations to decision-makers, diplomats and experts on nuclear security and non-proliferation critical issues.
