Resource consumption is about the consumption of non-renewable, or less often, renewable resources. Specifically, it may refer to:

water consumption
energy consumption
electric energy consumption
world energy consumption
natural gas consumption/gas depletion
oil consumption/oil depletion
logging/deforestation
fishing/overfishing
land use/land loss or
resource depletion and
general exploitation and associated environmental degradationMeasures of resource consumption are resource intensity and resource efficiency. Industrialization and globalized markets have increased the tendency for overconsumption of resources. The resource consumption rate of a nation does not usually correspond with the primary resource availability, this is called resource curse.
Unsustainable consumption by the steadily growing human population may lead to resource depletion and a shrinking of the earth's carrying capacity.
