The Three Physicists Prize (French: Prix des trois physiciens) is a physics prize awarded by the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris and the Eugène Bloch Foundation. It is named in honour of the physicists Henri Abraham, Eugene Bloch and Georges Bruhat, who were successive directors of the physics laboratory at the ENS and all of whom were murdered in Nazi concentration camps between 1943 and 1945. The prize was established by Bloch's widow.
