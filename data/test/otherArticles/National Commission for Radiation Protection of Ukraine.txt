The National Commission for Radiation Protection of Ukraine  (NCRPU)  is a permanent independent collegial supreme scientific expert advisory and consultative body to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) on matters of radiation protection and radiation safety of Ukraine. Its composition is being coordinated through the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.
Composition and regulations of the commission along with its president are confirmed by the Verkhovna Rada on proposition of the parliamentary committee on issues of ecological policy and natural resources. Composition and candidacy of the director is approved by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.

Goals
The main goal of NCRPU is to define common principles and criteria for radiation protection of human life and health from adverse effects of ionizing radiation.

Guidelines
In its activities NCRPU follows the Constitution of Ukraine, acts of the President and Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the Concept of radiation protection of the population of Ukraine in connection with the Chornobyl catastrophe, the laws of Ukraine «On protection from the effects of ionizing radiation», «On use of nuclear energy and radiation safety», «On legal regime of territories affected by radioactive contamination following the Chornobyl catastrophe», «On the status and social protection of citizens affected by the Chornobyl catastrophe», other regulations and NCRPU's Statute.
In addition, NCRPU is based in its activity on recommendations and conclusions of international organizations of which Ukraine is a member and/or with whom it has agreements on cooperation in assessing the impact of ionizing radiation on human health and on radiation protection of the public.

Activities
Under its determined authority and competence, NCRPU:

Is involved in developing and shaping national policy on state regulation of nuclear and radiation safety, radioactive materials (substances) and radioactive waste management, development and implementation in Ukraine of basic concepts, principles, rules, regulations, standards and measures of radiation protection of human, recommendations to reduce the impact of the radiation factor and of economic and social consequences of exposure to ionizing radiation on public health, as well as in creating a system of legal, socio-economic and institutional measures to ensure radiation protection and the protection of life and health of the public of Ukraine.

History
The National Commission for Radiation Protection of Ukraine  was established by Decree of the Parliament of Ukraine (Verkhovna Rada) No. 95 of August 1, 1990, in accordance with the Declaration on State Sovereignty of Ukraine of July 16, 1990 to provide science-based approach to solving the  problems of radiation protection, taking into account regional characteristics of the republic, increased participation in international cooperation on these issues.

In April 2009 Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has defined its powers in the field of radiation protection, supplementing the Law of Ukraine «On protection from the effects of ionizing radiation» by Article No. 8-1, according to which the Regulations and personal membership of NCRPU are approved by the Verkhovna Rada. In 2009 pursuant to this provision of the Law, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved the new NCRPU's Regulations (Decree of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine No. 1630-VI of October 6, 2009).
