The Lisbon Protocol to the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was a document signed by representatives of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan that recognized the four states as successors of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and all of them assume obligations of the Soviet Union under the START I treaty. The protocol was signed in Lisbon, Portugal, on 23 May 1992.

Background
When the Soviet Union dissolved on 26 December 1991, the Russian representative had already assumed the former Soviet seat in the UN headquarters on 25 December 1991. One of the issues was the fate of its nuclear weapons. Most were in the territory of Russia, but some were in the territories of Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. In July 1991, the Soviet Union had signed the START I nuclear disarmament treaty.
The signing of Protocol was taken place during the ongoing process of reorganization of former Soviet Union into Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and creation of Joint Armed Forces of the CIS following the signing of Alma-Ata Declaration in late 1991.

Article II

Article VI

Implementation
Although Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan had signed the protocol in May 1992, each state had to ratify and implement both the protocol and the Treaty. In Belarus and Ukraine, there was some resistance to giving up nuclear arms.  However, on 5 December 1994, all signatories to the Lisbon Protocol exchanged instruments of ratification, and the agreement came into force.
Russia was also able to ratify START I as the successor state to the Soviet Union.Kazakhstan's government was more interested in focusing resources on the country's development rather than on maintenance of a nuclear arsenal. In return for security guarantees, military aid, and financial assistance and compensation from the United States and Russia, Kazakhstan had surrendered all nuclear weapons to Russia by May 1995. Both Belarus and Ukraine resisted full implementation of the protocol during the 1990s, wishing to retain a nuclear deterrent force or a diplomatic bargaining chip. However, Belarus was economically dependent on Russia and eventually carried out its agreement to transfer all nuclear weapons to Russia. Like Kazakhstan, Ukraine eventually agreed to surrender its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees, military aid, financial assistance, and compensation from the United States and Russia. Implementation of the Lisbon Protocol was complete when both Belarus and Ukraine had surrendered their nuclear weapons to Russia by the end of 1996.

Ukraine
During the signing of the protocol Ukraine was concerned with numerous armed conflicts that took place throughout territory of the recently dissolved Soviet Union on pretence of local inter-ethnic skirmishes such as 1991–1992 South Ossetia War, Transnistria War, and others. Also on 11 January 1992 negotiations between Ukraine and the Russian Federations about the Black Sea Fleet fell through and concurrently with it the Russian parliamentary committees initiated revision of legal grounds of the 1954 Ukase of Presidium of the Soviet Supreme Soviet about transferring of Crimea to Ukraine.Within the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty which was signed between United States and Soviet Union, Ukraine was recognized as one of successors of the Soviet Union. According to Article V of the Protocol, Ukraine had to make a commitment to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a country-participant that does not possess nuclear weapon. While there was no specific timeframe, the document stipulated to ratify the treaty in the shortest time possible. The Lisbon Protocol provided that Ukraine equally with all its parties including the United States becomes a participant of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and has to ratify it. After dissolution of the Soviet Union, on territory of Ukraine was located 17% of the Soviet nuclear arsenal.Even before signing of the Lisbon Protocol, Ukraine has made several official declarations about its intent to become nuclear-free state among which are Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine (Article IX) as well as separate Law of Ukraine. After signing the protocol, on 1 October 1992 President Leonid Kravchuk declared at the 46th UN General Assembly Ukraine's intent to acquire the status of non-nuclear state.On 18 November 1993 Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) ratified both the START treaty and the Protocol in its parliamentary statement adopted at a closed door session where also were put forth conditions under which Ukraine may join the Non-Proliferation Treaty as well as list of issues that must become a subject of further negotiations. Following negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States, on 14 January 1994 there was signed the Trilateral declaration of presidents of Russia, United States, and Ukraine which was a road map on implementation of the START treaty. Right before the trilateral negotiations, procedural compliance within the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was further proscribed in bilateral Russia–Ukraine treaties (better known as Massandra Accords).
