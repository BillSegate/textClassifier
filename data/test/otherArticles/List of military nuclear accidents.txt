This article lists notable military accidents involving nuclear material. Civilian accidents are listed at List of civilian nuclear accidents. For a general discussion of both civilian and military accidents, see nuclear and radiation accidents. For other lists, see Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents.

Scope of this article
In listing military nuclear accidents, the following criteria have been adopted:

There must be well-attested and substantial health risks associated with nuclear materials.
To qualify as "military", the nuclear operation/material must be principally for military purposes.
To qualify as "accident", the damage should not be intentional, unlike in nuclear warfare.This list may be incomplete due to military secrecy.
