A Vulnerability Discovery Model (VDM) uses discovery event data with software reliability models for predicting the same.    A thorough presentation of VDM techniques is available in.  Numerous model implementations are available in the MCMCBayes open source repository.  Several VDM examples include:

Alhazmi-Malaiya: Time based model (Alhazmi-Malaiya Logistic (AML) model)
Alhazmi-Malaiya: Effort based model
Rescorla: Quadratic Model and Exponential Model 
Anderson: Thermodynamic Model
Kim: Weibull Model
Linear Model
Hump-Shaped Model
Independent and Dependent Model
Vulnerability Discovery Modeling using Bayesian model averaging
Multivariate Vulnerability Discovery Models
