Section 123 of the United States Atomic Energy Act of 1954, titled "Cooperation With Other Nations", establishes an agreement for cooperation as a prerequisite for nuclear deals between the US and any other nation. Such an agreement is called a 123 Agreement. To date, the U.S. has entered into roughly twenty-three 123 Agreements with 48 countries.
A 2009 123 agreement signed with the United Arab Emirates by the Obama Administration was called the "gold standard" of 123 agreements."[1]
